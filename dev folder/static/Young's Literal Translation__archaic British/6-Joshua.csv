Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,1,"1 And it cometh to pass after the death of Moses, servant of Jehovah, that Jehovah speaketh unto Joshua son of Nun, minister of Moses, saying, 2 'Moses my servant is dead, and now, rise, pass over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I am giving to them, to the sons of Israel. 3 'Every place on which the sole of your foot treadeth, to you I have given it, as I have spoken unto Moses. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,1,"2 'Every place on which the sole of your foot treadeth, to you I have given it, as I have spoken unto Moses. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,1,"4 From this wilderness and Lebanon, and unto the great river, the river Phrath, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great Sea — the going in of the sun — is your border. 5 'No man doth station himself before thee all days of thy life; as I have been with Moses, I am with thee, I do not fail thee, nor forsake thee; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,1,"5 'No man doth station himself before thee all days of thy life; as I have been with Moses, I am with thee, I do not fail thee, nor forsake thee; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,1,"6 be strong and courageous, for thou — thou dost cause this people to inherit the land which I have sworn to their fathers to give to them. 7 'Only, be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded thee; thou dost not turn aside from it right or left, so that thou dost act wisely in every [place] whither thou goest; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,1,"7 'Only, be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded thee; thou dost not turn aside from it right or left, so that thou dost act wisely in every [place] whither thou goest; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,1,"8 the book of this law doth not depart out of thy mouth, and thou hast meditated in it by day and by night, so that thou dost observe to do according to all that is written in it, for then thou dost cause thy way to prosper, and then thou dost act wisely. 9 'Have not I commanded thee? be strong and courageous; be not terrified nor affrighted, for with thee [is] Jehovah thy God in every [place] whither thou goest.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,1,"9 'Have not I commanded thee? be strong and courageous; be not terrified nor affrighted, for with thee [is] Jehovah thy God in every [place] whither thou goest.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,1,"10 And Joshua commandeth the authorities of the people, saying, 11 'Pass over into the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare for yourselves provision, for within three days ye are passing over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you to possess it.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,1,"11 'Pass over into the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare for yourselves provision, for within three days ye are passing over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you to possess it.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,1,"12 And to the Reubenite, and to the Gadite, and to the half of the tribe of Manasseh, hath Joshua spoken, saying, 13 'Remember the word which Moses, servant of Jehovah, commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God is giving rest to you, and He hath given to you this land; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,1,"13 'Remember the word which Moses, servant of Jehovah, commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God is giving rest to you, and He hath given to you this land; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,1,"14 your wives, your infants, and your substance, abide in the land which Moses hath given to you beyond the Jordan, and ye — ye pass over by fifties, before your brethren, all the mighty ones of valour, and have helped them, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,1,"15 till that Jehovah giveth rest to your brethren as to yourselves, and they have possessed, even they, the land which Jehovah your God is giving to them; then ye have turned back to the land of your possession, and have possessed it, which Moses, servant of Jehovah, hath given to you beyond the Jordan, [at] the sun-rising.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,1,"16 And they answer Joshua, saying, 'All that thou hast commanded us we do; and unto every [place] whither thou dost send us, we go; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,1,"17 according to all that we hearkened unto Moses [in], so we hearken unto thee; surely Jehovah thy God is with thee as He hath been with Moses. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,1,"18 Any man who doth provoke thy mouth, and doth not hear thy words, in all that thou dost command him, is put to death; only, be strong and courageous.' 2 "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"1 And Joshua son of Nun sendeth from Shittim, two men, spies, silently, saying, 'Go, see the land — and Jericho;' and they go and come into the house of a woman, a harlot, and her name [is] Rahab, and they lie down there. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"2 And it is told to the king of Jericho, saying, 'Lo, men have come in hither to-night, from the sons of Israel, to search the land. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"3 And the king of Jericho sendeth unto Rahab, saying, 'Bring out the men who are coming in unto thee, who have come into thy house, for to search the whole of the land they have come in. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"4 And the woman taketh the two men, and hideth them, and saith thus 'The men came in unto me, and I have not known whence they [are]; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"5 and it cometh to pass — the gate is to [be] shut — in the dark, and the men have gone out; I have not known whither the men have gone; pursue ye, hasten after them, for ye overtake them;' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"6 and she hath caused them to go up on the roof, and hideth them with the flax wood, which is arranged for her on the roof. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"7 And the men have pursued after them the way of the Jordan, by the fords, and the gate they have shut afterwards, when the pursuers have gone out after them. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"8 And — before they lie down — she hath gone up unto them on the roof, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"9 and she saith unto the men, 'I have known that Jehovah hath given to you the land, and that your terror hath fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted at your presence. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"11 And we hear, and melt doth our heart, and there hath not stood any more spirit in [any] man, from your presence, for Jehovah your God, He [is] God in the heavens above, and on the earth beneath. 12 'And now, swear ye, I pray you, to me by Jehovah — because I have done with you kindness — that ye have done, even ye, kindness with the house of my father, and have given to me a true token, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"12 'And now, swear ye, I pray you, to me by Jehovah — because I have done with you kindness — that ye have done, even ye, kindness with the house of my father, and have given to me a true token, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"13 and have kept alive my father, and my mother, and my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and have delivered our souls from death.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"14 And the men say to her, 'Our soul for yours — to die; if ye declare not this our matter, then it hath been, in Jehovah's giving to us this land, that we have done with thee kindness and truth.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"15 And she causeth them to go down by a rope through the window, for her house [is] in the side of the wall, and in the wall she [is] dwelling; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"16 and she saith to them, 'To the mountain go, lest the pursuers come upon you; and ye have been hidden there three days till the turning back of the pursuers, and afterwards ye go on your way.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"17 And the men say unto her, 'We are acquitted of this thine oath which thou hast caused us to swear "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"18 lo, we are coming into the land, this line of scarlet thread thou dost bind to the window by which thou hast caused us to go down, and thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all the house of thy father thou dost gather unto thee, to the house; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"19 and it hath been, any one who goeth out from the doors of thy house without, his blood [is] on his head, and we are innocent; and any one who is with thee in the house, his blood [is] on our head, if a hand is on him; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"20 and if thou declare this our matter, then we have been acquitted from thine oath which thou hast caused us to swear.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"21 And she saith, 'According unto your words, so it [is];' and she sendeth them away, and they go; and she bindeth the scarlet line to the window. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"22 And they go, and come in to the mountain, and abide there three days until the pursuers have turned back; and the pursuers seek in all the way, and have not found. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"23 And the two men turn back, and come down from the hill, and pass over, and come in unto Joshua son of Nun, and recount to him all that hath come upon them; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,2,"24 and they say unto Joshua, 'Surely Jehovah hath given into our hand all the land; and also, all the inhabitants of the land have melted at our presence.' 3 "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,3,"1 And Joshua riseth early in the morning, and they journey from Shittim, and come in unto the Jordan, he and all the sons of Israel, and they lodge there before they pass over. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,3,"2 And it cometh to pass, at the end of three days, that the authorities pass over into the midst of the camp, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,3,"3 and command the people, saying, 'When ye see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests, the Levites, bearing it, then ye journey from your place, and have gone after it; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,3,"4 only, a distance is between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure; ye do not come near unto it, so that ye know the way in which ye go, for ye have not passed over in the way heretofore.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,3,"5 And Joshua saith unto the people, 'Sanctify yourselves, for to-morrow doth Jehovah do in your midst wonders.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,3,"6 And Joshua speaketh unto the priests, saying, 'Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people;' and they take up the ark of the covenant, and go before the people. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,3,"7 And Jehovah saith unto Joshua, 'This day I begin to make thee great in the eyes of all Israel, so that they know that as I was with Moses I am with thee; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,3,"8 and thou, thou dost command the priests bearing the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye come unto the extremity of the waters of the Jordan — in the Jordan ye stand.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,3,"9 And Joshua saith unto the sons of Israel, 'Come nigh hither, and hear the words of Jehovah your God; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,3,"10 and Joshua saith, 'By this ye know that the living God [is] in your midst, and He doth certainly dispossess from before you the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,3,"11 lo, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is passing over before you into Jordan; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,3,"12 and now, take for you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, one man — one man for a tribe; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,3,"13 and it hath been, at the resting of the soles of the feet of the priests bearing the ark of Jehovah, Lord of all the earth, in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan are cut off — the waters which are coming down from above — and they stand — one heap.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,3,"14 And it cometh to pass, in the journeying of the people from their tents to pass over the Jordan, and of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,3,"15 and at those bearing the ark coming in unto the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark have been dipped in the extremity of the waters (and the Jordan is full over all its banks all the days of harvest) — "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,3,"16 that the waters stand; those coming down from above have risen — one heap, very far above Adam the city, which [is] at the side of Zaretan; and those going down by the sea of the plain, the Salt Sea, have been completely cut off; and the people have passed through over-against Jericho; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,3,"17 and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stand on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan — established, and all Israel are passing over on dry ground till that all the nation hath completed to pass over the Jordan. 4 "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"1 And it cometh to pass, when all the nation hath completed to pass over the Jordan, that Jehovah speaketh unto Joshua, saying, 2 'Take for you out of the people twelve men, one man — one man out of a tribe; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"2 'Take for you out of the people twelve men, one man — one man out of a tribe; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"3 and command ye them, saying, Take up for you from this [place], from the midst of the Jordan, from the established standing-place of the feet of the priests, twelve stones, and ye have removed them over with you, and placed them in the lodging-place in which ye lodge to-night.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"4 And Joshua calleth unto the twelve men whom he prepared out of the sons of Israel, one man — one man out of a tribe; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"5 and Joshua saith to them, 'Pass over before the ark of Jehovah your God unto the midst of the Jordan and lift up for you each, one stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"6 so that this is a sign in your midst, when your children ask hereafter, saying, What [are] these stones to you? "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"7 that ye have said to them, Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off, at the presence of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; in its passing over into the Jordan were the waters of the Jordan cut off; and these stones have been for a memorial to the sons of Israel — to the age.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"8 And the sons of Israel do so as Joshua commanded, and take up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah hath spoken unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel, and remove them over with them unto the lodging- place, and place them there, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"9 even the twelve stones hath Joshua raised up out of the midst of the Jordan, the place of the standing of the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant, and they are there unto this day. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"10 And the priests bearing the ark are standing in the midst of the Jordan till the completion of the whole thing which Jehovah commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua, and the people haste and pass over. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"11 And it cometh to pass when all the people have completed to pass over, that the ark of Jehovah passeth over, and the priests, in the presence of the people; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"12 and the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh, pass over, by fifties, before the sons of Israel, as Moses had spoken unto them; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"13 about forty thousand, armed ones of the host, passed over before Jehovah for battle, unto the plains of Jericho. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"14 On that day hath Jehovah made Joshua great in the eyes of all Israel, and they reverence him, as they reverenced Moses, all days of his life. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"15 And Jehovah speaketh unto Joshua, saying, 16 'Command the priests bearing the ark of the testimony, and they come up out of the Jordan.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"16 'Command the priests bearing the ark of the testimony, and they come up out of the Jordan.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"17 And Joshua commandeth the priests, saying, 'Come ye up out of the Jordan.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"18 And it cometh to pass, in the coming up of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the midst of the Jordan — the soles of the feet of the priests have been drawn up into the dry ground — and the waters of the Jordan turn back to their place, and go as heretofore over all its banks. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"19 And the people have come up out of the Jordan on the tenth of the first month, and encamp in Gilgal, in the extremity east of Jericho; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"20 and these twelve stones, which they have taken out of the Jordan, hath Joshua raised up in Gilgal. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"21 And he speaketh unto the sons of Israel, saying, 'When your sons ask their fathers hereafter, saying, What [are] these stones? "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"22 then ye have caused your sons to know, saying, On dry land Israel passed over this Jordan; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"23 because Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan at your presence, till your passing over, as Jehovah your God did to the Red Sea which He dried up at our presence till our passing over; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,4,"24 so that all the people of the land do know the hand of Jehovah that it [is] strong, so that ye have reverenced Jehovah your God all the days.'"
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"1 And it cometh to pass when all the kings of the Amorite which [are] beyond the Jordan, towards the sea, and all the kings of the Canaanite which [are] by the sea, hear how that Jehovah hath dried up the waters of the Jordan at the presence of the sons of Israel till their passing over, that their heart is melted, and there hath not been in them any more spirit because of the presence of the sons of Israel. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"2 At that time said Jehovah unto Joshua, 'Make for thee knives of flint, and turn back, circumcise the sons of Israel a second time;' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"3 and Joshua maketh for him knives of flint, and circumciseth the sons of Israel at the height of the foreskins. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"4 And this [is] the thing [for] which Joshua circumciseth [them] all the people who are coming out of Egypt, who are males, all the men of war have died in the wilderness, in the way, in their coming out of Egypt, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"5 for all the people who are coming out were circumcised, and all the people who [are] born in the wilderness, in the way, in their coming out from Egypt, they have not circumcised; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"6 for forty years have the sons of Israel gone in the wilderness, till all the nation of the men of war who are coming out of Egypt, who hearkened not to the voice of Jehovah, to whom Jehovah hath sworn not to show them the land which Jehovah sware to their fathers to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey, are consumed; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"7 and their sons He raised up in their stead, them hath Joshua circumcised, for they have been uncircumcised, for they have not circumcised them in the way. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"8 And it cometh to pass when all the nation have completed to be circumcised, that they abide in their places in the camp till their recovering; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"9 and Jehovah saith unto Joshua, 'To-day I have rolled the reproach of Egypt from off you;' and [one] calleth the name of that place Gilgal unto this day. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"10 And the sons of Israel encamp in Gilgal, and make the passover on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, in the plains of Jericho; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"11 and they eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow of the passover, unleavened things and roasted [corn], in this self-same day; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"12 and the manna doth cease on the morrow in their eating of the old corn of the land, and there hath been no more manna to the sons of Israel, and they eat of the increase of the land of Canaan in that year. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"13 And it cometh to pass in Joshua's being by Jericho, that he lifteth up his eyes, and looketh, and lo, one standing over-against him, and his drawn sword in his hand, and Joshua goeth unto him, and saith to him, 'Art thou for us or for our adversaries?' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"14 And He saith, 'No, for I [am] Prince of Jehovah's host; now I have come;' and Joshua falleth on his face to the earth, and doth obeisance, and saith to Him, 'What is my Lord speaking unto His servant?' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"15 And the Prince of Jehovah's host saith unto Joshua, 'Cast off thy shoe from off thy foot, for the place on which thou art standing is holy;' and Joshua doth so; 6 1 (And Jericho shutteth itself up, and is shut up, because of the presence of the sons of Israel — none going out, and none coming in;) "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"16 1 (And Jericho shutteth itself up, and is shut up, because of the presence of the sons of Israel — none going out, and none coming in;) "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"2 And Jehovah saith unto Joshua, 'See, I have given into thy hand Jericho and its king — mighty ones of valour, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,3 and ye have compassed the city — all the men of battle — going round the city once; thus thou dost six days; 
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"4 and seven priests do bear seven trumpets of the jubilee before the ark, and on the seventh day ye compass the city seven times, and the priests blow with the trumpets, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"5 and it hath been, in the prolongation of the horn of the jubilee, in your hearing the voice of the trumpet, all the people shout — a great shout, and the wall of the city hath fallen under it, and the people have gone up, each over-against him.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"6 And Joshua son of Nun calleth unto the priests, and saith unto them, 'Bear ye the ark of the covenant, and seven priests do bear seven trumpets of the jubilee before the ark of Jehovah;' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"7 and He said unto the people, 'Pass over, and compass the city, and he who is armed doth pass over before the ark of Jehovah.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"8 And it cometh to pass, when Joshua speaketh unto the people, that the seven priests bearing seven trumpets of the jubilee before Jehovah have passed over and blown with the trumpets, and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah is going after them; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"9 and he who is armed is going before the priests blowing the trumpets, and he who is gathering up is going after the ark, going on and blowing with the trumpets; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"10 and the people hath Joshua commanded, saying, 'Ye do not shout, nor cause your voice to be heard, nor doth there go out from your mouth a word, till the day of my saying unto you, Shout ye — then ye have shouted.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"11 And the ark of Jehovah doth compass the city, going round once, and they come into the camp, and lodge in the camp. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"12 And Joshua riseth early in the morning, and the priests bear the ark of Jehovah, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"13 and seven priests bearing seven trumpets of the jubilee before the ark of Jehovah are walking, going on, and they have blown with the trumpets — and he who is armed is going before them, and he who is gathering up is going behind the ark of Jehovah — going on and blowing with the trumpets. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"14 And they compass the city on the second day once, and turn back to the camp; thus they have done six days. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"15 And it cometh to pass, on the seventh day, that they rise early, at the ascending of the dawn, and compass the city, according to this manner, seven times; (only, on that day they have compassed the city seven times); "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"16 and it cometh to pass, at the seventh time, the priests have blown with the trumpets, and Joshua saith unto the people, 'Shout ye, for Jehovah hath given to you the city; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"17 and the city hath been devoted, it and all that [is] in it, to Jehovah; only Rahab the harlot doth live, she and all who [are] with her in the house, for she hid the messengers whom we sent; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"18 and surely ye have kept from the devoted thing, lest ye devote [yourselves], and have taken from the devoted thing, and have made the camp of Israel become a devoted thing, and have troubled it; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"19 and all the silver and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, holy they [are] to Jehovah; into the treasury of Jehovah they come.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"20 And the people shout, and blow with the trumpets, and it cometh to pass when the people hear the voice of the trumpet, that the people shout — a great shout, and the wall falleth under it, and the people goeth up into the city, each over-against him, and they capture the city; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"21 and they devote all that [is] in the city, from man even unto woman, from young even unto aged, even unto ox, and sheep, and ass, by the mouth of the sword. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"22 And to the two men who are spying the land Joshua said, 'Go into the house of the woman, the harlot, and bring out thence the woman, and all whom she hath, as ye have sworn to her.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"23 And the young man, the spies, go in and bring out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all whom she hath; yea, all her families they have brought out, and place them at the outside of the camp of Israel. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"24 And the city they have burnt with fire, and all that [is] in it; only, the silver and the gold, and the vessels of brass, and of iron, they have given [to] the treasury of the house of Jehovah; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"25 and Rahab the harlot, and the house of her father, and all whom she hath, hath Joshua kept alive; and she dwelleth in the midst of Israel unto this day, for she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"26 And Joshua adjureth [them] at that time, saying, 'Cursed [is] the man before Jehovah who raiseth up and hath built this city, [even] Jericho; in his first-born he doth lay its foundation, and in his youngest he doth set up its doors;' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,5,"27 and Jehovah is with Joshua, and his fame is in all the land. 7 "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,6,"1 And the sons of Israel commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and Achan, son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, taketh of the devoted thing, and the anger of Jehovah burneth against the sons of Israel. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,6,"2 And Joshua sendeth men from Jericho to Ai, which [is] near Beth- Aven, on the east of Bethel, and speaketh unto them, saying, 'Go up and spy the land;' and the men go up and spy Ai, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,6,"3 and they turn back unto Joshua, and say unto him, 'Let not all the people go up; let about two thousand men, or about three thousand men, go up, and they smite Ai; cause not all the people to labour thither; for they [are] few.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,6,"4 And there go up of the people thither about three thousand men, and they flee before the men of Ai, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,6,"5 and the men of Ai smite of them about thirty and six men, and pursue them before the gate unto Shebarim, and they smite them in Morad; and the heart of the people is melted, and becometh water. "

Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,6,"12 and the sons of Israel have not been able to stand before their enemies; the neck they turn before their enemies, for they have become a devoted thing; I add not to be with you — if ye destroy not the devoted thing out of your midst. 13 'Rise, sanctify the people, and thou hast said, Sanctify yourselves for to-morrow; for thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, A devoted thing [is] in thy midst, O Israel, thou art not able to stand before thine enemies till your turning aside of the devoted thing out of your midst; "

Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,8,"9 And they say unto him, 'From a land very far off have thy servants come, for the name of Jehovah thy God, for we have heard His fame, and all that He hath done in Egypt, "

Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,8,"12 this our bread — hot we provided ourselves with it out of our houses, on the day of our coming out to go unto you, and now, lo, it is dry, and hath been crumbs; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,8,"13 and these [are] the wine-bottles which we filled, new, and lo, they have rent; and these, our garments and our sandals, have become old, from the exceeding greatness of the way.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,8,"14 And the men take of their provision, and the mouth of Jehovah have not asked; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,8,"15 and Joshua maketh with them peace, and maketh with them a covenant, to keep them alive; and swear to them do the princes of the company. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,8,"16 And it cometh to pass, at the end of three days after that they have made with them a covenant, that they hear that they [are] their neighbours — that in their midst they are dwelling. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,8,"17 And the sons of Israel journey and come in unto their cities on the third day — and their cities [are] Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-Jearim — "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,8,"18 and the sons of Israel have not smitten them, for sworn to them have the princes of the company by Jehovah God of Israel, and all the company murmur against the princes. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,8,"19 And all the princes say unto all the company, 'We — we have sworn to them by Jehovah, God of Israel; and now, we are not able to come against them; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,8,"20 this we do to them, and have kept them alive, and wrath is not upon us, because of the oath which we have sworn to them.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,8,"21 And the princes say unto them, 'They live, and are hewers of wood and drawers of water for all the company, as the princes spake to them.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,8,"22 And Joshua calleth for them, and speaketh unto them, saying, 'Why have ye deceived us, saying, We are very far from you, and ye in our midst dwelling? "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,8,"23 and now, cursed are ye, and none of you is cut off [from being] a servant, even hewers of wood and drawers of water, for the house of my God.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,8,"24 And they answer Joshua and say, 'Because it was certainly declared to thy servants, that Jehovah thy God commanded Moses His servant to give to you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; and we fear greatly for ourselves because of you, and we do this thing; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,8,"25 and now, lo, we [are] in thy hand, as [it is] good, and as [it is] right in thine eyes to do to us — do.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,8,"26 And he doth to them so, and delivereth them from the hand of the sons of Israel, and they have not slain them; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,8,"27 and Joshua maketh them on that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the company, and for the altar of Jehovah, unto this day, at the place which He doth choose. 10 "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"1 And it cometh to pass, when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heareth that Joshua hath captured Ai, and doth devote it (as he had done to Jericho and to her king so he hath done to Ai and to her king), and that the inhabitants of Gibeon have made peace with Israel, and are in their midst, — "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"2 that they are greatly afraid, because Gibeon [is] a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it [is] greater than Ai, and all its men — heroes. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"3 And Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sendeth unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying, 4 'Come up unto me, and help me, and we smite Gibeon, for it hath made peace with Joshua, and with the sons of Israel.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"4 'Come up unto me, and help me, and we smite Gibeon, for it hath made peace with Joshua, and with the sons of Israel.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"5 And five kings of the Amorite (the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon) are gathered together, and go up, they and all their camps, and encamp against Gibeon, and fight against it. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"6 And the men of Gibeon send unto Joshua, unto the camp at Gilgal, saying, 'Let not thy hand cease from thy servants; come up unto us [with] haste, and give safety to us, and help us; for all the kings of the Amorite, dwelling in the hill-country, have been assembled against us.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"7 And Joshua goeth up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, even all the mighty men of valour. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"8 And Jehovah saith unto Joshua, 'Be not afraid of them, for into thy hand I have given them, there doth not stand a man of them in thy presence.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"9 And Joshua cometh in unto them suddenly (all the night he hath gone up from Gilgal), "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"10 and Jehovah doth crush them before Israel, and it smiteth them — a great smiting — at Gibeon, and pursueth them the way of the ascent of Beth-Horon, and smiteth them unto Azekah, and unto Makkedah. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"11 And it cometh to pass, in their fleeing from the face of Israel — they [are] in the descent of Beth-Horon — and Jehovah hath cast upon them great stones out of the heavens, unto Azekah, and they die; more are they who have died by the hailstones than they whom the sons of Israel have slain by the sword. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"12 Then speaketh Joshua to Jehovah in the day of Jehovah's giving up the Amorites before the sons of Israel, and he saith, before the eyes of Israel, 'Sun — in Gibeon stand still; and moon — in the valley of Ajalon;' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"13 and the sun standeth still, and the moon hath stood — till the nation taketh vengeance [on] its enemies; is it not written on the Book of the Upright, 'and the sun standeth in the midst of the heavens, and hath not hasted to go in — as a perfect day?' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"14 And there hath not been like that day before it or after it, for Jehovah's hearkening to the voice of a man; for Jehovah is fighting for Israel. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"15 And Joshua turneth back, and all Israel with him, unto the camp at Gilgal. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"16 And these five kings flee, and are hidden in a cave at Makkedah, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"17 and it is declared to Joshua, saying, 'The five kings have been found hidden in a cave at Makkedah.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"18 And Joshua saith, 'Roll great stones unto the mouth of the cave, and appoint over it men to watch them; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"19 and ye, stand not, pursue after your enemies, and ye have smitten the hindmost of them; suffer them not to go in unto their cities, for Jehovah your God hath given them into your hand.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"20 And it cometh to pass, when Joshua and the sons of Israel finish to smite them — a very great smiting, till they are consumed, and the remnant who have remained of them go in unto the fenced cities, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"21 that all the people turn back to the camp, unto Joshua, [at] Makkedah, in peace; none moved sharply his tongue against the sons of Israel. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"22 And Joshua saith, 'Open ye the mouth of the cave, and bring out unto me these five kings from the cave;' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"23 and they do so, and bring out unto him these five kings from the cave the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"24 And it cometh to pass, when they bring out these kings unto Joshua, that Joshua calleth unto every man of Israel, and saith unto the captains of the men of war, who have gone with him, 'Draw near, set your feet on the necks of these kings;' and they draw near, and set their feet on their necks. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"25 And Joshua saith unto them, 'Fear not, nor be affrighted; be strong and courageous; for thus doth Jehovah do to all your enemies with whom ye are fighting;' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"26 and Joshua smiteth them afterwards, and putteth them to death, and hangeth them on five trees; and they are hanging on the trees till the evening. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"27 And it cometh to pass, at the time of the going in of the sun, Joshua hath commanded, and they take them down from off the trees, and cast them unto the cave where they had been hid, and put great stones on the mouth of the cave till this very day. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"28 And Makkedah hath Joshua captured on that day, and he smiteth it by the mouth of the sword, and its king he hath devoted, them and every person who [is] in it — he hath not left a remnant; and he doth to the king of Makkedah as he did to the king of Jericho. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"29 And Joshua passeth over, and all Israel with him, from Makkedah [to] Libnah, and fighteth with Libnah; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"30 and Jehovah giveth also it into the hand of Israel, and its king, and it smiteth it by the mouth of the sword, and every person who [is] in it — it left not in it a remnant; and it doth to its king as it did to the king of Jericho. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"31 And Joshua passeth over, and all Israel with him, from Libnah to Lachish, and encampeth against it, and fighteth against it; "

Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"33 Than hath Horam king of Gezer come up to help Lachish, and Joshua smiteth him and his people, till he hath not left to him a remnant. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"34 And Joshua passeth over, and all Israel with him, from Lachish to Eglon, and they encamp against it, and fight against it, "

"
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"38 And Joshua turneth back, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fighteth against it, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"39 and captureth it, and its king, and all its cities, and they smite them by the mouth of the sword, and devote every person who [is] in it — he hath not left a remnant; as he did to Hebron so he did to Debir, and to its king, and as he did to Libnah, and to its king. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"40 And Joshua smiteth all the land of the hill-country, and of the south, and of the low-country, and of the springs, and all their kings — he hath not left a remnant, and all that doth breathe he hath devoted, as Jehovah, God of Israel, commanded.

Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"41 And Joshua smiteth them from Kadesh-Barnea, even unto Gaza, and all the land of Goshen, even unto Gibeon; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"42 and all these kings and their land hath Joshua captured [at] one time, for Jehovah, God of Israel, is fighting for Israel. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Joshua,9,"43 and Joshua turneth back, and all Israel with him, unto the camp at Gilgal. 11 "

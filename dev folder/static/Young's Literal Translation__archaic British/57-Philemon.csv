Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon, THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO PHILEMON,
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"1 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timotheus the brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow- worker, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"2 and Apphia the beloved, and Archippus our fellow-soldier, and the assembly in thy house "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"3 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ! "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"4 I give thanks to my God, always making mention of thee in my prayers, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"5 hearing of thy love and faith that thou hast unto the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,6 that the fellowship of thy faith may become working in the full knowledge of every good thing that [is] in you toward Christ Jesus; 
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"7 for we have much joy and comfort in thy love, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"8 Wherefore, having in Christ much boldness to command thee that which is fit — "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"9 because of the love I rather entreat, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"10 I entreat thee concerning my child — whom I did beget in my bonds — Onesimus, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"11 who once was to thee unprofitable, and now is profitable to me and to thee, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"12 whom I did send again, and thou him (that is, my own bowels) receive, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"13 whom I did wish to retain to myself, that in thy behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the good news, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"14 and apart from thy mind I willed to do nothing, that as of necessity thy good deed may not be, but of willingness, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"15 for perhaps because of this he did depart for an hour, that age-duringly thou mayest have him, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"16 no more as a servant, but above a servant — a brother beloved, especially to me, and how much more to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord! "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"17 If, then, with me thou hast fellowship, receive him as me, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"18 and if he did hurt to thee, or doth owe anything, this to me be reckoning; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"19 I, Paul did write with my hand, I — I will repay; that I may not say that also thyself, besides, to me thou dost owe. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"20 Yes, brother, may I have profit of thee in the Lord; refresh my bowels in the Lord; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"21 having been confident in thy obedience I did write to thee, having known that also above what I may say thou wilt do; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"22 and at the same time also prepare for me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted to you. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"23 Salute thee doth Epaphras, (my fellow-captive in Christ Jesus,) "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,"24 Markus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lukas, my fellow-workmen! "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Philemon,1,25 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [is] with your spirit! Amen.

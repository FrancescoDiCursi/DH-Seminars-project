Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs, The Proverbs,
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"1 Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"2 For knowing wisdom and instruction, For understanding sayings of intelligence, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"3 For receiving the instruction of wisdom, Righteousness, judgment, and uprightness, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"4 For giving to simple ones — prudence, To a youth — knowledge and discretion. 5 (The wise doth hear and increaseth learning, And the intelligent doth obtain counsels.) "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"5 (The wise doth hear and increaseth learning, And the intelligent doth obtain counsels.) "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"6 For understanding a proverb and its sweetness, Words of the wise and their acute sayings. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"7 Fear of Jehovah [is] a beginning of knowledge, Wisdom and instruction fools have despised! "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"8 Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, And leave not the law of thy mother, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"9 For a graceful wreath [are] they to thy head, And chains to thy neck. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"10 My son, if sinners entice thee be not willing. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"11 If they say, 'Come with us, we lay wait for blood, We watch secretly for the innocent without cause, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"12 We swallow them as Sheol — alive, And whole — as those going down [to] the pit, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"13 Every precious substance we find, We fill our houses [with] spoil, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"14 Thy lot thou dost cast among us, One purse is — to all of us.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"15 My son! go not in the way with them, Withhold thy foot from their path, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"16 For their feet to evil do run, And they haste to shed blood. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,17 Surely in vain is the net spread out before the eyes of any bird. 
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"18 And they for their own blood lay wait, They watch secretly for their own lives. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"19 So [are] the paths of every gainer of dishonest gain, The life of its owners it taketh. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"20 Wisdom in an out-place crieth aloud, In broad places she giveth forth her voice, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"21 At the head of the multitudes she calleth, In the openings of the gates, In the city her sayings she saith 22 'Till when, ye simple, do ye love simplicity? And have scorners their scorning desired? And do fools hate knowledge? "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"22 'Till when, ye simple, do ye love simplicity? And have scorners their scorning desired? And do fools hate knowledge? "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"23 Turn back at my reproof, lo, I pour forth to you my spirit, I make known my words with you. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"24 Because I have called, and ye refuse, I stretched out my hand, and none is attending, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"25 And ye slight all my counsel, And my reproof ye have not desired. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"26 I also in your calamity do laugh, I deride when your fear cometh, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"27 When your fear cometh as destruction, And your calamity as a hurricane doth come, When on you come adversity and distress. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"28 Then they call me, and I do not answer, They seek me earnestly, and find me not. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"29 Because that they have hated knowledge, And the fear of Jehovah have not chosen. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"30 They have not consented to my counsel, They have despised all my reproof, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"31 And they eat of the fruit of their way, And from their own counsels they are filled. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"32 For the turning of the simple slayeth them, And the security of the foolish destroyeth them. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,1,"33 And whoso is hearkening to me dwelleth confidently, And [is] quiet from fear of evil!' 2 "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,2,"1 My son, if thou dost accept my sayings, And my commands dost lay up with thee, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,2,"2 To cause thine ear to attend to wisdom, Thou inclinest thy heart to understanding, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,2,"3 For, if for intelligence thou callest, For understanding givest forth thy voice, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,2,"4 If thou dost seek her as silver, And as hid treasures searchest for her, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,2,"5 Then understandest thou fear of Jehovah, And knowledge of God thou findest. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,2,"6 For Jehovah giveth wisdom, From His mouth knowledge and understanding. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,2,"7 Even to lay up for the upright substance, A shield for those walking uprightly. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,2,"8 To keep the paths of judgment, And the way of His saints He preserveth. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,2,"9 Then understandest thou righteousness, And judgment, and uprightness — every good path. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,2,"10 For wisdom cometh into thy heart, And knowledge to thy soul is pleasant, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,2,"11 Thoughtfulness doth watch over thee, Understanding doth keep thee, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,2,"12 To deliver thee from an evil way, From any speaking froward things, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,2,"13 Who are forsaking paths of uprightness, To walk in ways of darkness, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,2,"14 Who are rejoicing to do evil, They delight in frowardness of the wicked, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,2,"15 Whose paths [are] crooked, Yea, they are perverted in their ways. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,2,"16 To deliver thee from the strange woman, From the stranger who hath made smooth her sayings, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,2,"17 Who is forsaking the guide of her youth, And the covenant of her God hath forgotten. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,2,"18 For her house hath inclined unto death, And unto Rephaim her paths. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,2,"19 None going in unto her turn back, Nor do they reach the paths of life. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,2,"20 That thou dost go in the way of the good, And the paths of the righteous dost keep. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,2,"21 For the upright do inhabit the earth, And the perfect are left in it, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,2,"22 And the wicked from the earth are cut off, And treacherous dealers plucked out of it! 3 "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"1 My son! my law forget not, And my commands let thy heart keep, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"2 For length of days and years, Life and peace they do add to thee. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"3 Let not kindness and truth forsake thee, Bind them on thy neck, Write them on the tablet of thy heart, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,4 And find grace and good understanding In the eyes of God and man. 
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"5 Trust unto Jehovah with all thy heart, And unto thine own understanding lean not. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"6 In all thy ways know thou Him, And He doth make straight thy paths. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"7 Be not wise in thine own eyes, Fear Jehovah, and turn aside from evil. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"8 Healing it is to thy navel, And moistening to thy bones. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"9 Honour Jehovah from thy substance, And from the beginning of all thine increase; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"10 And filled are thy barns [with] plenty, And [with] new wine thy presses break forth. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"11 Chastisement of Jehovah, my son, despise not, And be not vexed with His reproof, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"12 For whom Jehovah loveth He reproveth, Even as a father the son He is pleased with. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"13 O the happiness of a man [who] hath found wisdom, And of a man [who] bringeth forth understanding. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"14 For better [is] her merchandise Than the merchandise of silver, And than gold — her increase. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"15 Precious she [is] above rubies, And all thy pleasures are not comparable to her. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"16 Length of days [is] in her right hand, In her left [are] wealth and honour. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"17 Her ways [are] ways of pleasantness, And all her paths [are] peace. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"18 A tree of life she [is] to those laying hold on her, And whoso is retaining her [is] happy. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"19 Jehovah by wisdom did found the earth, He prepared the heavens by understanding. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"20 By His knowledge depths have been rent, And clouds do drop dew. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"21 My son! let them not turn from thine eyes, Keep thou wisdom and thoughtfulness, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"22 And they are life to thy soul, and grace to thy neck. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"23 Then thou goest thy way confidently, And thy foot doth not stumble. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"24 If thou liest down, thou art not afraid, Yea, thou hast lain down, And sweet hath been thy sleep. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"25 Be not afraid of sudden fear, And of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"26 For Jehovah is at thy side, And He hath kept thy foot from capture. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"27 Withhold not good from its owners, When thy hand [is] toward God to do [it]. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"28 Say not thou to thy friend, 'Go, and return, and to-morrow I give,' And substance with thee. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"29 Devise not against thy neighbour evil, And he sitting confidently with thee. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"30 Strive not with a man without cause, If he have not done thee evil. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"31 Be not envious of a man of violence, Nor fix thou on any of his ways. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"32 For an abomination to Jehovah [is] the perverted, And with the upright [is] His secret counsel. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,33 The curse of Jehovah [is] in the house of the wicked. And the habitation of the righteous He blesseth. 
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"34 If the scorners He doth scorn, Yet to the humble He doth give grace. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,3,"35 Honour do the wise inherit, And fools are bearing away shame! 4 "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"1 Hear, ye sons, the instruction of a father, And give attention to know understanding. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"2 For good learning I have given to you, My law forsake not. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"3 For, a son I have been to my father — tender, And an only one before my mother. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"4 And he directeth me, and he saith to me 'Let thy heart retain my words, Keep my commands, and live. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"5 Get wisdom, get understanding, Do not forget, nor turn away From the sayings of my mouth. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"6 Forsake her not, and she doth preserve thee, Love her, and she doth keep thee. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"7 The first thing [is] wisdom — get wisdom, And with all thy getting get understanding. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"8 Exalt her, and she doth lift thee up, She honoureth thee, when thou dost embrace her. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"9 She giveth to thy head a wreath of grace, A crown of beauty she doth give thee freely. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"10 Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, And years of life [are] multiplied to thee. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"11 In a way of wisdom I have directed thee, I have caused thee to tread in paths of uprightness. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"12 In thy walking thy step is not straitened, And if thou runnest, thou stumblest not. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"13 Lay hold on instruction, do not desist, Keep her, for she [is] thy life. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"14 Into the path of the wicked enter not, And be not happy in a way of evil doers. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"15 Avoid it, pass not over into it, Turn aside from it, and pass on. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"16 For they sleep not if they do not evil, And their sleep hath been taken violently away, If they cause not [some] to stumble. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"17 For they have eaten bread of wickedness, And wine of violence they drink. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"18 And the path of the righteous [is] as a shining light, Going and brightening till the day is established, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"19 The way of the wicked [is] as darkness, They have not known at what they stumble. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"20 My son, to my words give attention, To my sayings incline thine ear, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"21 Let them not turn aside from thine eyes, Preserve them in the midst of thy heart. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"22 For life they [are] to those finding them, And to all their flesh healing. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"23 Above every charge keep thy heart, For out of it [are] the outgoings of life. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"24 Turn aside from thee a froward mouth, And perverse lips put far from thee, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"25 Thine eyes do look straightforward, And thine eyelids look straight before thee. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"26 Ponder thou the path of thy feet, And all thy ways [are] established. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,4,"27 Incline not [to] the right or to the left, Turn aside thy foot from evil! 5 "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"1 My son! to my wisdom give attention, To mine understanding incline thine ear, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"2 To observe thoughtfulness, And knowledge do thy lips keep. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"3 For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And smoother than oil [is] her mouth, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"4 And her latter end [is] bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a sword [with] mouths. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"5 Her feet are going down to death, Sheol do her steps take hold of. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"6 The path of life — lest thou ponder, Moved have her paths — thou knowest not. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"7 And now, ye sons, hearken to me, And turn not from sayings of my mouth. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"8 Keep far from off her thy way, And come not near unto the opening of her house, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"9 Lest thou give to others thy honour, And thy years to the fierce, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"10 Lest strangers be filled [with] thy power, And thy labours in the house of a stranger, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"11 And thou hast howled in thy latter end, In the consumption of thy flesh and thy food, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"12 And hast said, 'How have I hated instruction, And reproof hath my heart despised, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"13 And I have not hearkened to the voice of my directors, And to my teachers have not inclined mine ear. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"14 As a little thing I have been all evil, In the midst of an assembly and a company. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"15 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, Even flowing ones out of thine own well. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"16 Let thy fountains be scattered abroad, In broad places rivulets of waters. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"17 Let them be to thee for thyself, And not to strangers with thee. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"18 Let thy fountain be blessed, And rejoice because of the wife of thy youth, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"19 A hind of loves, and a roe of grace! Let her loves satisfy thee at all times, In her love magnify thyself continually. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"20 And why dost thou magnify thyself, My son, with a stranger? And embrace the bosom of a strange woman? "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"21 For over-against the eyes of Jehovah are the ways of each, And all his paths He is pondering. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"22 His own iniquities do capture the wicked, And with the ropes of his sin he is holden. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,5,"23 He dieth without instruction, And in the abundance of his folly magnifieth himself! 6 "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"1 My son! if thou hast been surety for thy friend, Hast stricken for a stranger thy hand, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"2 Hast been snared with sayings of thy mouth, Hast been captured with sayings of thy mouth, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"3 Do this now, my son, and be delivered, For thou hast come into the hand of thy friend. Go, trample on thyself, and strengthen thy friend, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"4 Give not sleep to thine eyes, And slumber to thine eyelids, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"5 Be delivered as a roe from the hand, And as a bird from the hand of a fowler. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"6 Go unto the ant, O slothful one, See her ways and be wise; "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"7 Which hath not captain, overseer, and ruler, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"8 She doth prepare in summer her bread, She hath gathered in harvest her food. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"9 Till when, O slothful one, dost thou lie? When dost thou arise from thy sleep? "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"10 A little sleep, a little slumber, A little clasping of the hands to rest, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"11 And thy poverty hath come as a traveller, And thy want as an armed man. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"12 A man of worthlessness, a man of iniquity, Walking [with] perverseness of mouth, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"13 Winking with his eyes, speaking with his feet, Directing with his fingers, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"14 Frowardness [is] in his heart, devising evil at all times, Contentions he sendeth forth. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"15 Therefore suddenly cometh his calamity, Instantly he is broken — and no healing. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"16 These six hath Jehovah hated, Yea, seven [are] abominations to His soul. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,17 Eyes high — tongues false — And hands shedding innocent blood — 
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,18 A heart devising thoughts of vanity — Feet hasting to run to evil — 
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,19 A false witness [who] doth breathe out lies — And one sending forth contentions between brethren. 
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"20 Keep, my son, the command of thy father, And leave not the law of thy mother. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"21 Bind them on thy heart continually, Tie them on thy neck. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"22 In thy going up and down, it leadeth thee, In thy lying down, it watcheth over thee, And thou hast awaked — it talketh [with] thee. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"23 For a lamp [is] the command, And the law a light, And a way of life [are] reproofs of instruction, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"24 To preserve thee from an evil woman, From the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"25 Desire not her beauty in thy heart, And let her not take thee with her eyelids. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"26 For a harlot consumeth unto a cake of bread, And an adulteress the precious soul hunteth. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"27 Doth a man take fire into his bosom, And are his garments not burnt? "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"28 Doth a man walk on the hot coals, And are his feet not scorched? "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"29 So [is] he who hath gone in unto the wife of his neighbour, None who doth touch her is innocent. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"30 They do not despise the thief, When he stealeth to fill his soul when he is hungry, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"31 And being found he repayeth sevenfold, All the substance of his house he giveth. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"32 He who committeth adultery [with] a woman lacketh heart, He is destroying his soul who doth it. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"33 A stroke and shame he doth find, And his reproach is not wiped away, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"34 For jealousy [is] the fury of a man, And he doth not spare in a day of vengeance. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,6,"35 He accepteth not the appearance of any atonement, Yea, he doth not consent, Though thou dost multiply bribes! 7 "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"1 My son! keep my sayings, And my commands lay up with thee. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"2 Keep my commands, and live, And my law as the pupil of thine eye. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"3 Bind them on thy fingers, Write them on the tablet of thy heart. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"4 Say to wisdom, 'My sister Thou [art].' And cry to understanding, 'Kinswoman!' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"5 To preserve thee from a strange woman, From a stranger who hath made smooth her sayings. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"6 For, at a window of my house, Through my casement I have looked out, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"7 And I do see among the simple ones, I discern among the sons, A young man lacking understanding, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"8 Passing on in the street, near her corner, And the way [to] her house he doth step, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"9 In the twilight — in the evening of day, In the darkness of night and blackness. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"10 And, lo, a woman to meet him — (A harlot's dress, and watchful of heart, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"11 Noisy she [is], and stubborn, In her house her feet rest not. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"12 Now in an out-place, now in broad places, And near every corner she lieth in wait) — "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"13 And she laid hold on him, and kissed him, She hath hardened her face, and saith to him, 14 'Sacrifices of peace-offerings [are] by me, To-day I have completed my vows. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"14 'Sacrifices of peace-offerings [are] by me, To-day I have completed my vows. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"15 Therefore I have come forth to meet thee, To seek earnestly thy face, and I find thee. 16 [With] ornamental coverings I decked my couch, Carved works — cotton of Egypt. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"16 [With] ornamental coverings I decked my couch, Carved works — cotton of Egypt. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"17 I sprinkled my bed — myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"18 Come, we are filled [with] loves till the morning, We delight ourselves in loves. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"19 For the man is not in his house, He hath gone on a long journey. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"20 A bag of money he hath taken in his hand, At the day of the new moon he cometh to his house.' "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"21 She turneth him aside with the abundance of her speech, With the flattery of her lips she forceth him. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"22 He is going after her straightway, As an ox unto the slaughter he cometh, And as a fetter unto the chastisement of a fool, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"23 Till an arrow doth split his liver, As a bird hath hastened unto a snare, And hath not known that it [is] for its life. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"24 And now, ye sons, hearken to me, And give attention to sayings of my mouth. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"25 Let not thy heart turn unto her ways, Do not wander in her paths, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"26 For many [are] the wounded she caused to fall, And mighty [are] all her slain ones. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,7,"27 The ways of Sheol — her house, Going down unto inner chambers of death! 8 "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,8,1 Doth not wisdom call? And understanding give forth her voice? 
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,8,"2 At the head of high places by the way, Between the paths she hath stood, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,8,"3 At the side of the gates, at the mouth of the city, The entrance of the openings, she crieth aloud, 4 'Unto you, O men, I call, And my voice [is] unto the sons of men. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,8,"4 'Unto you, O men, I call, And my voice [is] unto the sons of men. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,8,"5 Understand, ye simple ones, prudence, And ye fools, understand the heart, "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,8,"6 Hearken, for noble things I speak, And the opening of my lips [is] uprightness. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,8,"7 For truth doth my mouth utter, And an abomination to my lips [is] wickedness. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,8,"8 In righteousness [are] all the sayings of my mouth, Nothing in them is froward and perverse. "
Young's Literal Translation__archaic British,Proverbs,8,"9 All of them [are] plain to the intelligent, And upright to those finding knowledge. "

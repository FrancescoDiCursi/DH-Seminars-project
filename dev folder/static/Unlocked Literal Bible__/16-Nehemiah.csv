Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah, Nehemiah,
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,1,"1 The words of Nehemiah son of Hakaliah Now it happened in the month of Kislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in the fortress of Susa, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,1,"2 that one of my brothers, Hanani, came with some people from Judah, and I asked them about the Jews who had escaped, the remnant of the Jews who were there, and about Jerusalem. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,1,"3 They said to me, “Those in the province who survived the captivity are in great trouble and disgrace because the wall of Jerusalem has been broken open, and its gates have been set on fire.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,1,"4 As soon as I heard these words, I sat down and wept, and for days I continued grieving and fasting and praying before the God of heaven. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,1,"5 Then I said, “You are Yahweh, God of heaven, the God who is great and awesome, who keeps the covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,1,"6 Listen to my prayer and open your eyes, so you may hear the prayer of your servant that I now pray before you day and night for the people of Israel your servants. I am confessing the sins of the people of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Both I and my father's house have sinned. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,1,"7 We have acted very wickedly against you, and we have not kept the commandments, the statutes, and the rules you commanded your servant Moses. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,1,"8 Please call to mind the word you commanded your servant Moses, 'If you act unfaithfully, I will scatter you among the nations, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,1,"9 but if you return to me and follow my commandments and do them, though your people were scattered under the farthest skies, I will gather them from there and bring them to that place where I have chosen to make my name remain.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,1,"10 Now they are your servants and your people, whom you have rescued by your great power and by your strong hand. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,1,"11 Yahweh, I beg you, listen now to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight to honor your name. Now give success to your servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.” I served as cupbearer to the king. 2 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,2,"1 In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, he selected wine, and I took the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had never before been sad in his presence. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,2,"2 But the king said to me, “Why is your face so sad? You do not appear to be ill. This must be sadness of heart.” Then I became very much afraid. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,2,"3 I said to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should not my face be sad? The city, the place of my fathers' tombs, lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,2,"4 Then the king said to me, “What do you want me to do?” So I prayed to the God of heaven. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,2,"5 I replied to the king, “If it seems good to the king, and if your servant has done well in your sight, you could send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' tombs, that I may rebuild it.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,2,"6 The king replied to me (and the queen was also sitting beside him), “How long shall you be away and when will you return?” The king was glad to send me when I gave him the dates. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,2,"7 Then I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, may letters be given to me for the governors in the Province Beyond the River so that they may permit me to pass through their territories on my way to Judah. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,2,"8 May there also be a letter for Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, so that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress next to the temple, and for the wall of the city, and for the house in which I will live.” So because the good hand of God was on me, the king granted me my requests."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,2,9 I came to the governors in the Province Beyond the River and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,2,"10 When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant heard this, they were greatly displeased that someone had come who was seeking to help the people of Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,2,11 So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,2,"12 I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. I did not tell anyone what my God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. There was no animal with me, other than the one I was riding. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,2,"13 I went out by night by the Valley Gate, toward the Jackal's Well and to the Dung Gate, and inspected the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken open, and the wooden gates were destroyed by fire. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,2,14 Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the King's Pool. The place was too narrow for the animal I was riding to pass through. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,2,"15 So I went up that night by the valley and inspected the wall, and I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,2,"16 The rulers did not know where I went or what I did, and I had not yet informed the Jews, nor the priests, nor the nobles, nor the rulers, nor the rest who did the work. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,2,"17 I said to them, “You see the trouble we are in, how Jerusalem lies in ruins and its gates have been destroyed by fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, so we will no longer be in disgrace.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,2,"18 I told them that the good hand of my God was on me and also about the king's words that he had spoken to me. They said, “Let us rise up and build.” So they strengthened their hands for the good work. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,2,"19 But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the Ammonite servant, and Geshem the Arabian heard about it, they mocked and ridiculed us, and they said, “What are you doing? Are you rebelling against the king?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,2,"20 Then I answered them, “The God of heaven will give us success. We are his servants and we will arise and build. But you have no share, no right, and no historic claim in Jerusalem.” 3 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,3,"1 Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brother priests, and they built the Sheep Gate. They consecrated it and set its doors in place. They consecrated it as far as the Tower of the Hundred and as far as the Tower of Hananel. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,3,26 Now the temple servants living in Ophel repaired to the point opposite the Water Gate on the east and the projecting tower.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,3,32 The goldsmiths and the merchants repaired between the upper chamber of the corner and the Sheep Gate. 4 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,"1 Now when Sanballat heard we were building the wall, it burned within him, and he was furiously angry, and he mocked the Jews. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,"2 In the presence of his brothers and the army of Samaria, he said, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore the city for themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish the work in a day? Will they bring to life the stones from the piles of rubble after they were burned? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,"3 Tobiah the Ammonite was with him, and he said, “If only a fox went up on what they are building, it would break down their stone wall!” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,"4 Hear, our God, for we are despised. Turn back their taunts on their own heads and give them up to be plundered in a land where they are prisoners. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,"5 Do not cover over their iniquity and do not erase their sin from before you, for they have provoked the builders to anger. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,"6 So we built the wall and all the wall was joined together to half its height, for the people had a desire to work. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,"7 But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabians, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the work of repairing the walls of Jerusalem was going forward, and that the broken places in the wall were being closed up, a great anger burned within them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,"8 They all conspired together, and they came to fight against Jerusalem and to cause confusion in it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,9 But we prayed to our God and set a guard as protection against them day and night because of their threat. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,"10 Then the people of Judah said, “The strength of those who carry the burdens is failing. There is too much rubble, and we are not able to rebuild the wall.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,"11 Our enemies said, “They will not know or see until we come among them and kill them, and stop the work.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,"12 At that time the Jews who lived near them came from all directions and spoke to us ten times, warning us about the schemes they were making against us. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,"13 So I positioned people in the lowest parts of the wall in the exposed areas. I positioned each family with their swords, spears, and bows. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,"14 Then I looked, and stood up, and I said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Call to mind the Lord, who is great and awesome. Fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives, and your homes.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,"15 It came about when our enemies heard that their plans were known to us, and God had frustrated their plans, all of us returned to the wall, each one to his work. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,"16 So from that time half of my servants worked only on rebuilding the wall, and half of them held spears, shields, bows, and wore armor, while the leaders stood behind all the people of Judah. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,"17 The same workers who were building the wall and carrying loads were also guarding their positions. Everyone worked with one hand, and with the other hand he held his weapon. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,18 Every builder wore his sword on his side and that is how he worked. The one who sounded the trumpet stayed beside me. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,"19 I said to the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people, “The work is great and extensive, and we are separated on the wall, far from one another. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,20 You must rush to the place where you hear the trumpet sound and assemble there. Our God will fight for us.” 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,21 So we were doing the work. Half of them were holding spears from the rising of the dawn until the coming out of the stars. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,"22 I also said to the people at that time, “Let every man and his servant spend the night in the middle of Jerusalem, so they may be for us a guard during the night and a worker in the day.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,4,"23 So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us changed our clothes, and each of us carried his weapon, even if he went for water. 5 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,5,1 Then the men and their wives raised a great outcry against their fellow Jews. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,5,"2 For there were some who said, “With our sons and daughters we are many. So let us get grain that we may eat and stay alive.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,5,"3 There were also some who said, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our houses to get grain during the famine.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,5,"4 Some also said, “We have borrowed money to pay the king's tax on our fields and our vineyards. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,5,"5 Yet now our flesh and blood is the same as our brothers, and our children are the same as their children. We are forced to sell our sons and our daughters to become slaves. Some of our daughters have already been enslaved. But it is not in our power to help it because other mennow own our fields and our vineyards.”"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,5,6 I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these words. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,5,"7 Then I thought about this, and brought charges against the nobles and officials. I said to them, “You are exacting interest, each from his own brother.” I held a great assembly against them "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,5,"8 and said to them, “We, as much as we are able, have bought back from slavery our Jewish brothers who had been sold to the nations, but you even sell your brothers and sisters that they may be sold back to us!” They were silent and never found a word to say. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,5,"9 Also I said, “What you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God to prevent the taunts of the nations that are our enemies? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,5,10 I and my brothers and my servants are lending them money and grain. But we must stop charging interest on these loans. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,5,"11 Return to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive orchards, and their houses and the percentage of the money, the grain, the new wine, and the oil that you exacted from them.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,5,"12 Then they said, “We will return what we took from them, and will require nothing from them. We will do as you say.” Then I called the priests, and made them swear to do as they had promised. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,5,"13 I shook out the fold of my robe and said, “So may God shake out of his house and possessions every man who does not keep his promise. So may he be shaken out and emptied.” All the assembly said, “Amen,” and they praised Yahweh and the people did as they had promised. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,5,"14 So from the time I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ate the food provided for the governor. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,5,"15 But the former governors who were before me laid heavy burdens on the people, and took from them forty shekels of silver for their daily food and wine. Even their servants oppressed the people. But I did not do so because of the fear of God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,5,"16 I also continued to work on the wall, and we bought no land, and all my servants were gathered there for the work. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,5,"17 At my table were the Jews and the officials,  150 men, besides those who came to us from among the nations who were around us. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,5,"18 Now what was prepared each day was one ox, six choice sheep, and also birds, and every ten days all kinds of wine in abundance, yet for all this I did not demand the food allowance of the governor, because the demands were too heavy on the people. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,5,"19 Call me to mind, my God, for good, because of all that I have done for this people. 6 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,6,"1 Now when Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and that there were no longer any sections left broken open, although I had not yet set up the doors in the gates, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,6,"2 Sanballat and Geshem sent to me saying, “Come, let us meet together somewhere in the plain of Ono.” But they intended to do harm to me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,6,"3 I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work, and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,6,"4 They sent me the same message four times, and I answered them the same way each time. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,6,"5 Sanballat sent his servant to me in the same way the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,6,"6 In it was written, “It is reported among the nations, and Geshem also says it, that you and the Jews are planning to rebel, for that is why you are rebuilding the wall. From what these reports say, you are about to become their king."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,6,"7 You have also appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem, saying, 'There is a king in Judah!' You can be sure the king will hear these reports. Therefore come, let us speak with one another.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,6,"8 Then I sent word to him saying, “No such things have occurred as you say, for within your heart you invented them.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,6,"9 For they all wanted to make us afraid, thinking, “They will drop their hands from doing the work, and it will not be done.” But now, God, please strengthen my hands. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,6,"10 I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah son of Mehetabel, who was confined in his home. He said, “Let us meet together in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you. At night they are coming to kill you.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,6,"11 I replied, “Would a man like me run away? Would a man like me go into the temple just so he could save his own life? I will not go in!” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,6,"12 I realized that it was not God who sent him, but that he had prophesied against me. Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,6,"13 They hired him to make me afraid, so that I might do what he said and sin, so they could give me a bad name in order to humiliate me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,6,"14 Call to mind Tobiah and Sanballat, my God, and all that they did. Also call to mind the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who tried to make me be afraid. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,6,"15 So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month of Elul, after fifty-two days. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,6,"16 When all our enemies heard of it, all the nations around us, they became afraid and they fell greatly in their own eyes. For they knew the work was done with the help of our God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,6,"17 At this time the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah's letters came to them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,6,"18 For there were many in Judah who were bound by an oath to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah. His son Jehohanan had taken as his wife the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,6,19 They also spoke to me about his good deeds and reported my words back to him. Letters were sent to me from Tobiah to frighten me. 7 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,7,"1 When the wall was finished and I had set up the doors in place, and the gatekeepers and singers and Levites had been appointed, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,7,"2 I gave my brother Hanani charge over Jerusalem, along with Hananiah who had oversight of the fortress, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,7,"3 I said to them, “Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun is hot. While the gatekeepers are on guard, you may shut the doors and bar them. Appoint guards from those who live in Jerusalem, some at the place of their guard station, and some in front of their own homes.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,7,"4 Now the city was wide and large, but there were few people within it, and no houses had yet been rebuilt. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,7,"5 My God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, the officials, and the people to enroll them by their families. I found the book of the genealogy of those who returned at the first and found the following written in it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,7,"6 “These are the people of the province who went up out of the captivity of those exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon took into exile. They returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, each to his city. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,7,"7 They came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel included the following. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,12,"27 At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the people sought out the Levites wherever they lived, to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication with joy, with thanksgivings and singing with cymbals, harps, and with lyres. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,12,28 The fellowship of singers gathered together from the district around Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,12,"29 They also came from Beth Gilgal and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built for themselves villages around Jerusalem. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,12,"30 The priests and the Levites purified themselves, and then they purified the people, the gates, and the wall. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,12,"31 Then I had the leaders of Judah go up to the top of the wall, and I appointed two large choirs who gave thanks. One went to the right on the wall toward the Dung Gate. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,12,"32 Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed them, "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,12,"38 The other choir of those who gave thanks went in the other direction. I followed them on the wall with half the people, above the Tower of Ovens, to the Broad Wall, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,12,"39 and above the Gate of Ephraim, and by the Old Gate, and by the Fish Gate and the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, to the Sheep Gate, and they stopped at the Gate of the Guard. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,12,"40 So both choirs of those who gave thanks took their place in the house of God, and I also took my place with half of the officials with me. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,12,"44 On that day men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for the contributions, the firstfruits, and the tithes, to gather into them the portions required by the law for the priests and for the Levites. Each was assigned to work the fields near the towns. For Judah rejoiced over the priests and the Levites who were standing before them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,12,"45 They performed the service of their God, and the service of purification, and so did the singers and the gatekeepers, in keeping with the command of David and of Solomon his son. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,12,"46 For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there were directors of singers, and there were songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,12,"47 In the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah, all Israel gave the daily portions for the singers and the gatekeepers. They set aside the portion that was for the Levites, and the Levites set aside a portion for the descendants of Aaron."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"1 On that day they read in the Book of Moses in the hearing of the people. It was found written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite should come into the assembly of God, forever. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"2 This was because they had not come to the people of Israel with bread and with water, but they had hired Balaam to curse Israel. However, our God turned the curse into a blessing. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"3 As soon as they heard the law, they separated out from Israel every foreign person. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,4 Now before this Eliashib the priest was appointed over the storerooms of the house of our God. He was related to Tobiah. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"5 Eliashib prepared for Tobiah a large storeroom, where previously they kept the grain offering, the incense, the articles, and the tithes of the grain, new wine, and the oil, which were designated for the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the contributions for the priests. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"6 But in all this time I was not in Jerusalem. For in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king. After some time I asked the king for permission to leave, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,7 and I returned to Jerusalem. I understood the evil that Eliashib had done by giving Tobiah a storeroom in the courts of the house of God. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,8 I was very angry and I threw all Tobiah's household articles out of the storeroom. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"9 I ordered that they purify the storerooms, and I put back in them the articles of the house of God, the grain offerings, and the incense. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"10 I learned that the Levites' portions had not been given to them, and they had run away, each to his own field, the Levites and the singers who did the work. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"11 So I confronted the officials and said, “Why is the house of God neglected?” I gathered them together and stationed them at their posts. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"12 Then all Judah brought in the tithe of the grain, the new wine, and the oil to the storerooms. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"13 I appointed as treasurers over the storehouses Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe, and from the Levites, Pedaiah. Next to them was Hanan son of Zaccur son of Mattaniah, for they were counted as trustworthy. Their duties were to distribute the supplies to their associates. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"14 Call me to mind, my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out the good deeds that I have done for the house of my God and its services. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"15 In those days I saw in Judah people treading winepresses on the Sabbath and bringing in heaps of grain and loading them on donkeys, and also wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of heavy loads, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. I protested that they were selling food on that day. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"16 Men from Tyre living in Jerusalem brought in fish and all kinds of goods, and they sold them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah and in the city! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"17 Then I confronted the leaders of Judah, “What is this evil thing you are doing, profaning the Sabbath day? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,18 Did not your fathers do this? Did not our God bring all this evil on us and on this city? Now you are bringing more wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.” 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"19 As soon as it became dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors be shut and that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. I stationed some of my servants at the gates so no load could be brought in on the Sabbath day. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,20 The merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares camped outside Jerusalem once or twice. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"21 But I warned them, “Why do you camp outside the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you!” From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"22 Then I commanded the Levites to purify themselves, and come and guard the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day. Call me to mind for this also, my God, and have mercy on me because of the covenant loyalty you have toward me."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"23 In those days I also saw Jews that had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"24 Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod. None of them could speak the language of Judah, but only the language of one of the other peoples. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"25 I confronted them, and I cursed them, and I hit some of them and pulled out their hair. I made them swear by God, saying, “You shall not give your daughters to their sons, or take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"26 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin on account of these women? Among many nations there was no king like him, and he was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless, his foreign wives caused him to sin. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"27 Should we then listen to you and do all this great evil, and act treacherously against our God by marrying foreign women?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,28 One of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high priest was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. Therefore I caused him to flee from my presence. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"29 Call them to mind, my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"30 Thus I cleansed them from everything foreign, and established the duties of the priests and the Levites, each to his own task. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nehemiah,13,"31 I provided for the wood offering at the appointed times and for the firstfruits. Call me to mind, my God, for good."

Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy, Second Timothy,
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,1,"1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of the life that is in Christ Jesus, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,1,"2 to Timothy, beloved child Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,1,"3 I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers, with a clean conscience, as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,1,"4 As I remember your tears, I long to see you, that I may be filled with joy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,1,"5 I have been reminded of your genuine faith, which lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am convinced that it lives in you also. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,1,6 This is the reason I am reminding you to rekindle the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,1,"7 For God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power and love and discipline. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,1,"8 So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor of me, Paul, his prisoner. Instead, share in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,1,"9 It is God who saved us and called us with a holy calling. He did this, not according to our works, but according to his own plan and grace. He gave us these things in Christ Jesus before times ever began. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,1,10 But now God's salvation has been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus. It is Christ who put an end to death and brought life that never ends to light through the gospel. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,1,"11 Because of this, I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher. * "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,1,"12 For this cause I also suffer these things. But I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed. I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have entrusted to him until that day. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,1,"13 Keep the example of faithful messages that you heard from me, with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,1,"14 The good thing that God committed to you, guard it through the Holy Spirit, who lives in us. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,1,"15 You know this, that all who live in Asia turned away from me. In this group are Phygelus and Hermogenes. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,1,"16 May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,1,"17 Instead, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and he found me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,1,"18 May the Lord grant to him to find mercy from him on that day. All the ways he helped me in Ephesus, you know very well. 2 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,"1 You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,"2 The things you heard from me among many witnesses, entrust them to faithful people who will be able to teach others also. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,"3 Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,"4 No soldier serves while entangled in the affairs of this life, so that he may please his superior officer. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,"5 Also, if someone competes as an athlete, he is not crowned unless he competes by the rules. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,6 It is necessary that the hardworking farmer receive his share of the crops first. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,"7 Think about what I am saying, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,"8 Remember Jesus Christ, from David's seed, who was raised from the dead. This is according to my gospel message, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,9 for which I am suffering to the point of being bound with chains as a criminal. But the word of God is not bound. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,"10 Therefore I endure all things for those who are chosen, so that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,"11 This is a trustworthy saying * “If we have died with him, we will also live with him."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,"12 If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he also will deny us. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,"13 if we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,"14 Keep reminding them of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen. * "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,"15 Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no reason to be ashamed, who accurately teaches the word of truth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,"16 Avoid profane talk, which leads to more and more godlessness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,"17 Their talk will spread like cancer. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,"18 who have gone astray from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already happened, and they destroy the faith of some. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,"19 However, the firm foundation of God stands. It has this inscription “The Lord knows those who are his” and “Everyone who names the name of the Lord must depart from unrighteousness.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,"20 In a wealthy home, there are not only containers of gold and silver. There are also containers of wood and clay. Some of these are for honorable use, and some for dishonorable. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,"21 If someone cleans himself from dishonorable use, he is an honorable container. He is set apart, useful to the Master, and prepared for every good work. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,"22 Flee youthful lusts. Pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a clean heart. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,23 But refuse foolish and ignorant questions. You know that they give birth to arguments. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,"24 The Lord's servant must not quarrel. Instead he must be gentle toward all, able to teach, and patient. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,25 He must in meekness educate those who oppose him. God may perhaps give them repentance for the knowledge of the truth. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,2,"26 They may become sober again and leave the devil's trap, after they have been captured by him for his will. 3 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,3,1 But know this In the last days there will be difficult times. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,3,"2 For people will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, and unholy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,3,"3 They will be without natural affection, unable to reconcile, slanderers, without self-control, violent, not lovers of good. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,3,"4 They will be betrayers, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,3,"5 They will have a shape of godliness, but they will deny its power. Turn away from these people. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,3,6 For some of them are men who enter into households and captivate foolish women. These are women who are heaped up with sins and are led away by various desires. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,3,"7 These women are always learning, but they are never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,3,"8 In the same way that Jannes and Jambres stood against Moses, these false teachers also stand against the truth. They are men corrupt in mind, and with regard to the faith they are proven to be false. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,3,"9 But they will not advance very far. For their foolishness will be obvious to all, just like that of those men. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,3,"10 But as for you, you have followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,3,"11 persecutions, sufferings, and what happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra. I endured persecutions. Out of them all, the Lord rescued me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,3,12 All those who want to live in a godly manner in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,3,"13 Evil people and impostors will go from bad to worse, leading others and themselves astray. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,3,"14 But as for you, remain in the things that you have learned and have firmly believed. You know from whom you have learned. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,3,15 You know that from * childhood you have known the sacred writings. These are able to make you wisefor salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,3,"16 All scripture has been inspired by God. It is profitable for doctrine, for conviction, for correction, and for training in righteousness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,3,"17 This is so that the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work. 4 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,4,"1 I give this solemn command before God and Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and because of his appearing and his kingdom "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,4,"2 Preach the word; be ready when it is convenient and when it is not. Reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all patience and teaching. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,4,"3 For the time will come when people will not endure sound teaching. Instead, they will heap up for themselves teachers according to their own desires, who say what their itching ears want to hear. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,4,"4 They will turn their hearing away from the truth, and they will turn aside to myths. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,4,"5 But you, be sober-minded in all things. Suffer hardship; do the work of an evangelist; fulfill your service. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,4,6 For I am already being poured out. The time of my departure has come. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,4,7 I have competed in the good contest; I have finished the race; I have kept the faith. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,4,"8 The crown of righteousness has been reserved for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day, and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,4,9 Do your best to come to me quickly. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,4,"10 For Demas has left me. He loves this present world and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens went to Galatia, and Titus went to Dalmatia. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,4,11 Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you because he is useful to me in the work. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,4,12 Tychicus I sent to Ephesus. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,4,"13 The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, bring it when you come, and the books, especially the parchments. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,4,14 Alexander the coppersmith displayed many evil deeds against me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,4,"15 You also should guard yourself against him, because he greatly opposed our words. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,4,"16 At my first defense, no one stood with me. Instead, everyone left me. May it not be counted against them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,4,"17 But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me so that, through me, the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear it; and that I was rescued out of the lion's mouth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,4,18 The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and will save me for his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,4,"19 Greet Priscilla, Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,4,"20 Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I left sick at Miletus. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,4,"21 Do your best to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, also Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Timothy,4,22 May the Lord be with your spirit. May grace be with you.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians, Philippians,
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,"1 Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all those set apart in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,2 May grace be to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,3 I thank my God every time I remember you; 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,"4 and always in every prayer for all of you, I pray with joy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,5 I give thanks for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,"6 I am confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will continue to complete it until the day of Jesus Christ. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,7 It is right for me to feel this way about all of you because I have you in my heart. You all have been my partners in grace both in my imprisonment and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,"8 For God is my witness, how I long for all of you with the compassion of Christ Jesus. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,9 I am praying this That your love may abound more and more in knowledge and all understanding. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,"10 I pray for this so that you may approve what is excellent, and so you may be sincere and without offense on the day of Christ. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,"11 I pray that you also will be filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,"12 Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,"13 As a result, my chains in Christ came to light throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,"14 Most of the brothers have far more confidence in the Lord because of my chains, and they have courage to fearlessly speak the word. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,"15 Some indeed even proclaim Christ out of envy and strife, and also others out of good will. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,"16 The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,"17 But the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely. They think they will afflict me while I am in chains. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,"18 What then? Only that in every way—whether from false motives or from true—Christ is proclaimed, and in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,19 for I know that this will result in my deliverance through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,"20 It is my eager expectation and certain hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but that I will have complete boldness, so that now as always, Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,21 For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,"22 But if I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which to choose? I do not know. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,"23 For I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, which is far better, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,24 yet to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,"25 Being convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,26 so that in me you may have increasing reasons to boast in Christ Jesus when I come to you again. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,"27 Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come to see you or am absent, I may hear about you, that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,"28 Do not be frightened in any respect by those who are your opponents. This is a sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation—and this from God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,"29 For it has been granted to you, for the sake of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for his sake, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,1,"30 having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now you hear in me."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,"1 If there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any comfort from his love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if there are any tender mercies and compassions, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,"2 then make my joy full by thinking alike, having the same love, being united in spirit, and having the same purpose. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,3 Do nothing out of selfishness or empty conceit. Instead with humility consider others better than yourselves. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,"4 Each of you should take care not only for your own needs, but also for the needs of others. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,5 You should have the same attitude toward one another as was in Christ Jesus. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,"6 He existed in the form of God, but he did not consider his equality with God as something to hold on to. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,"7 Instead, he emptied himself by taking the form of a servant, and he was born in the likeness of men. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,"8 He humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death, even death of a cross! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,9 Therefore God also highly exalted him. He gave him the name that is above every name. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,"10 He did this so that in the name of Jesus every knee should bend, the knees of those in heaven and on earth and under the earth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,"11 He did this so that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,"12 So then, my beloved, as you always obey, not only in my presence but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,13 For it is God who is working in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,14 Do all things without complaining or arguing. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,"15 Act in this way so that you may become blameless and honest, children of God without blemish. Act in this way so that you may shine as lights in the world, in the middle of a crooked and depraved generation. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,16 Hold tightly to the word of life so that I may have reason to glory on the day of Christ. For then I will know that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,"17 But even if I am being poured out as an offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,18 In the same manner you also should be glad and rejoice with me. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,"19 But I have hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I may also be encouraged when I know the things about you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,"20 For I have no one else with his same attitude, who is truly anxious for you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,"21 For they all seek their own interests, not the things of Jesus Christ. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,"22 But you know his worth, because as a child serves his father, so he served with me in the gospel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,23 So I hope to send him as soon as I see how things will go with me. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,24 But I am confident in the Lord that I myself will also come soon. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,"25 But I think it is necessary to send Epaphroditus back to you. He is my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and servant for my needs. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,"26 For he was very distressed, and he longed to be with you all, because you heard that he was sick. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,"27 For indeed he was so sick that he almost died. But God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but also on me, so that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,"28 So it is all the more eagerly that I am sending him, so that when you see him again you may rejoice, and I can be free from anxiety. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,29 Welcome Epaphroditus in the Lord with all joy. Honor people like him. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,2,30 For it was for the work of Christ that he came near death. He risked his life to serve me and fill up what you could not do in service to me.
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,3,"1 Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. For me to write these same things again to you is no trouble for me, and it keeps you safe. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,3,"2 Watch out for the dogs, those evil workers, those who mutilate the flesh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,3,"3 For it is we who are the circumcision. It is we who worship by the Spirit of God. It is we who take pride in Christ Jesus, and who have no confidence in the flesh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,3,"4 Even so, I myself could have confidence in the flesh. If anyone thinks he has confidence in the flesh, I could have even more. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,3,"5 I was circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; with regard to the law, a Pharisee. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,3,"6 As for zeal, I persecuted the church; as for righteousness under the law, I was blameless. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,3,"7 But whatever things were a profit for me, I have considered them as loss because of Christ. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,3,"8 In fact, now I count all things to be loss because of the surpassing value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. For him I have given up all things—and I consider them rubbish—so that I may gain Christ "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,3,"9 and be found in him. I do not have a righteousness of my own from the law. Instead, I have the righteousness that is through faith in Christ, the righteousness that is from God based on faith. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,3,"10 So now I want to know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings. I want to be transformed into the likeness of his death, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,3,11 so somehow I may experience the resurrection from the dead. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,3,"12 It is not true that I have already received these things, or that I have become complete. But I press on in order that I may grasp that for which I was grasped by Christ Jesus. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,3,"13 Brothers, I do not think that I myself have yet grasped it. But there is one thing I forget what is behind and strain for what is ahead. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,3,14 I press on toward the goal to win the prize of the upward calling of God in Christ Jesus. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,3,"15 All of us who are mature, let us think this way; and if you think differently about anything, God will also reveal that to you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,3,"16 However, whatever we have reached, let us hold on to it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,3,"17 Be imitators of me, brothers. Closely watch those who are walking by the example that you have in us. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,3,"18 Many are walking—those about whom I have often told you, and now I am telling you with tears—as enemies of the cross of Christ. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,3,"19 Their end is destruction. For their god is their stomach, and their pride is in their shame. They think about earthly things. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,3,"20 But our citizenship is in heaven, from where we also wait for a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,3,"21 He will transform our lowly bodies into bodies formed like his glorious body, formed by the might of his power to subject all things to himself. 4 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,"1 Therefore, my beloved brothers whom I long for, my joy and crown, in this way stand firm in the Lord, beloved friends. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,"2 I am pleading with Euodia, and I am pleading with Syntyche, be of the same mind in the Lord. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,"3 Yes, I ask you, my true companion, to help these women who labored with me in spreading the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,"4 Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say, rejoice. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,5 Let your gentleness be known to all people. The Lord is near. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,"6 Do not be anxious about anything. Instead, in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be known to God, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,"7 and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,"8 Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is anything excellent, if there isanything to be praised, think about these things. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,"9 The things that you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, do these things, and the God of peace will be with you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,"10 I greatly rejoice in the Lord because now at last you have renewed your concern for me. You had indeed been concerned for me before, but there was no opportunity for you to help. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,11 I am not saying this because I am in need. For I have learned to be content in all circumstances. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,"12 I know what it is to be poor, and I also know what it is to have plenty. In every way and in all things I have learned the secret of how to be well-fed or to be hungry, and how to have an abundance or to be in need. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,13 I can do all things through him who strengthens me. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,"14 However, you did well to share with me in my difficulties. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,"15 You Philippians know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church supported me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,"16 Even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent help for my needs more than once. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,"17 It is not that I seek the gift. Instead, I seek the fruit that increases to your credit. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,"18 I have received everything in full, and even more. I have been well-supplied now that I have received from Epaphroditus the things you sent. They are a sweet-smelling aroma, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,19 My God will meet all your needs according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,20 Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever. Amen. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,21 Greet every believer in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,"22 All the believers here greet you, especially those of Caesar's household. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philippians,4,23 May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. * *

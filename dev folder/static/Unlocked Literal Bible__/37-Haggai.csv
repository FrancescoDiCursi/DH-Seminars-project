Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,1,"2 “Yahweh of hosts says this These people say, 'It is not time for us to come or to build Yahweh's house.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,1,"3 Then the word of Yahweh came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,1,"4 “Is it a time for you yourselves to live in your finished houses, while this house lies ruined? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,1,5 So now Yahweh of hosts says this Consider your ways! 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,1,"6 You have sown much seed, but bring in little harvest; you eat but do not have enough; you drink but cannot get drunk. You wear clothes but cannot warm yourselves, and the wage earner earns money only to put it into a bag full of holes! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,1,7 Yahweh of hosts says this “Consider your ways! 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,1,"8 Go up to the mountain, bring timber, and build my house; then I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified!—says Yahweh.” "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,1,"12 Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, along with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of Yahweh their God and the words of Haggai the prophet, because Yahweh their God had sent him and the people feared the face of Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,1,"13 Then Haggai, the messenger of Yahweh, spoke Yahweh's message to the people and said, “I am with you!—this is Yahweh's declaration!” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,1,"14 So Yahweh stirred up the spirit of the governor of Judah, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and the spirit of the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people, so that they went and worked on the house of Yahweh of hosts, their God "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,2,"2 “Speak to the governor of Judah, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and to the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, and to the remnant of the people.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,2,"5 This is the covenant that I established with you when you came out of Egypt, and my Spirit remains with you. Do not fear! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,2,"6 For Yahweh of hosts says this In a little while I will once again shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,2,"7 I will shake every nation, and every nation will bring their precious things to me, and I will fill this house with glory, says Yahweh of hosts. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,2,8 The silver and gold are mine!—this is the declaration of Yahweh of hosts. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,2,"9 The glory of this house will be greater in the future than at the beginning, says Yahweh of hosts, and I will give peace in this place!—this is the declaration of Yahweh of hosts.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,2,"10 On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,2,"11 “Yahweh of hosts says this Ask the priests concerning the law, and say, 12 'If a man carries meat that is set apart to Yahweh in the fold of his garment, and the fold touches bread or stew, wine or oil, or any kind of food, does it become holy?'” The priests answered and said, “No.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,2,"12 'If a man carries meat that is set apart to Yahweh in the fold of his garment, and the fold touches bread or stew, wine or oil, or any kind of food, does it become holy?'” The priests answered and said, “No.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,2,"13 Then Haggai said, “If someone who is unclean because of death touches any of these things, do they become unclean?” The priests answered and said, “Yes, they become unclean.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,2,"14 So Haggai answered and said, “So it is with this people and this nation before me!—this is Yahweh's declaration—and so it is with everything done by their hands. What they offer to me is unclean! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,2,"15 So now, think in your minds about the past leading up to this very day. Before stone was placed upon stone in the temple of Yahweh, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,2,"16 how was it then? When you came to a heap of twenty measures of grain, there were only ten; and when you came to the wine vat to draw out fifty measures, there were only twenty. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,2,"17 I afflicted you and all the work of your hands with blight and mildew, but you still did not turn to me—this is Yahweh's declaration. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,2,"18 Consider from this day forward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the day that the foundation of Yahweh's temple was laid. Consider it! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,2,"19 Is there still seed in the storehouse? The vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not produced! But from this day will I bless you!” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,2,"20 Then the word of Yahweh came a second time to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month and said, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,2,"21 “Speak to the governor of Judah, Zerubbabel, and say, 'I will shake the heavens and the earth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,2,"22 For I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms and destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations! I will overthrow the chariots and their riders; the horses and their riders will fall down, each one because of his brother's sword. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Haggai,2,"23 On that day—this is the declaration of Yahweh of hosts—I will take you, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, as my servant—this is Yahweh's declaration. I will make you like a signet ring, for I have chosen you! —this is the declaration of Yahweh of hosts!'”"

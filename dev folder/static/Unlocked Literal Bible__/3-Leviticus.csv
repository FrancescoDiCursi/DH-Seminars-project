Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,1,"1 Yahweh called to Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,1,"2 “Speak to the people of Israel and tell them, 'When any man from among you brings an offering to Yahweh, bring as your offering one of your animals, either from the herd or from the flock. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,1,"3 If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he must offer a male without blemish. He is to offer it at the entrance of the tent of meeting, so that it may be accepted before Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,1,"4 He is to lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and then it will be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for himself. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,1,"5 Then he must kill the bull before Yahweh. Aaron's sons, the priests, will present the blood and sprinkle it on the altar that is at the entrance of the tent of meeting. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,1,6 Then he must skin the burnt offering and cut it to pieces. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,1,7 Then the sons of Aaron the priest will put fire on the altar and place wood to feed the fire. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,1,"8 Aaron's sons, the priests, are to place the pieces, the head and the fat, in order on the wood that is on the fire which is on the altar. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,1,9 But its inner parts and its legs he must wash with water. Then the priest will burn everything on the altar as a burnt offering. It will produce a sweet aroma for me; it will be an offering made to me by fire. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,1,"10 If his offering for the burnt offering is from the flock, one of the sheep or one of the goats, he must offer a male without blemish. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,1,"11 He must kill it on the north side of the altar before Yahweh. Aaron's sons, the priests, will sprinkle its blood on every side of the altar. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,1,"12 Then he must cut it into pieces, with its head and its fat, and the priest will lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire, which is on the altar, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,1,"13 but the inner parts and the legs he must wash with water. Then the priest will offer the whole, and burn it on the altar. It is a burnt offering, and it will produce a sweet aroma for Yahweh; it will be an offering made to him by fire. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,1,"14 If his offering to Yahweh is to be a burnt offering of birds, then he must bring as his offering either a dove or a young pigeon. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,1,"15 The priest must bring it to the altar, wring off its head, and burn it on the altar. Then its blood must be drained out on the side of the altar. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,1,"16 He must remove its crop with its contents, and throw it beside the altar on the east side, in the place for the ashes. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,1,"17 He must tear it open by its wings, but he must not divide it into two parts. Then the priest will burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire. It will be a burnt offering, and it will produce a sweet aroma for Yahweh; it will be an offering made to him by fire. 2 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,2,"1 When anyone brings a grain offering to Yahweh, his offering must be fine flour, and he will pour oil on it and put incense on it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,2,"2 He is to take the offering to Aaron's sons the priests, and there the priest will take out a handful of the fine flour with the oil and the incense on it. Then the priest will burn the offering on the altar as a representative offering. It will produce a sweet aroma for Yahweh; it will be an offering made to him by fire. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,2,3 Whatever is left of the grain offering will belong to Aaron and his sons. It is very holy to Yahweh from the offerings to Yahweh made by fire.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,2,"8 You must bring the grain offering made from these things to Yahweh, and it will be presented to the priest, who will bring it to the altar. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,2,"9 Then the priest will take some from the grain offering as a representative offering, and he will burn it on the altar. It will be an offering made by fire, and it will produce a sweet aroma for Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,2,10 What is left of the grain offering will belong to Aaron and his sons. It is very holy to Yahweh from the offerings to Yahweh made by fire. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,2,"11 No grain offering that you offer to Yahweh is to be made with yeast, for you must burn no leaven, nor any honey, as an offering made by fire to Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,2,"12 You will offer them to Yahweh as an offering of firstfruits, but they will not be used to produce a sweet aroma on the altar. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,2,13 You must season each of your grain offerings with salt. You must never allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be missing from your grain offering. With all your offerings you must offer salt. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,2,"14 If you offer a grain offering of firstfruits to Yahweh, offer fresh grain that is roasted with fire and then crushed into meal. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,2,15 Then you must put oil and incense on it. This is a grain offering. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,2,16 Then the priest will burn part of the crushed grain and oil and incense as a representative offering. This is an offering made by fire to Yahweh. 3 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,3,"1 If someone offers a sacrifice which is a fellowship offering of an animal from the herd, whether male or female, he must offer an animal without blemish before Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,3,2 He will lay his hand on the head of his offering and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting. Then Aaron's sons the priests will sprinkle its blood on the sides of the altar. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,3,"3 The man will offer the sacrifice of a fellowship offering by fire to Yahweh. The fat that covers or is connected to the inner parts, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,3,"4 and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the loins, and the lobe of the liver, with the kidneys—he will remove all of this. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,3,"9 The man will offer the sacrifice of fellowship offerings as an offering made by fire to Yahweh. The fat, the entire fat tail cut away close to the backbone, and the fat that covers the inner parts and all the fat that is near the inner parts, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,3,"10 and the two kidneys and the fat that is with them, which is by the loins, and the lobe of the liver, with the kidneys—he will remove all of this. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,3,11 Then the priest will burn it all on the altar as a burnt offering of food to Yahweh.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,3,"16 The priest will burn all that on the altar as a burnt offering of food, to produce a sweet aroma. All the fat belongs to Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,3,"17 It will be a permanent statute throughout your people's generations in every place you make your home, that you must not eat fat or blood.'” 4 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"2 “Tell the people of Israel, 'When anyone sins without wanting to sin, doing any of the things that Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and if he does something that is prohibited, the following must be done. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"3 If it is the high priest who sins so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer for his sin which he has committed a young bull without blemish to Yahweh as a sin offering. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"4 He must bring the bull to the entrance of the tent of meeting before Yahweh, lay his hand on its head, and kill the bull before Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,5 The anointed priest will take some of the blood of the bull and take it to the tent of meeting. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"6 The priest will dip his finger into the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times before Yahweh, before the curtain of the most holy place. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"7 Then the priest will put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense before Yahweh, which is in the tent of meeting, and he will pour out all the rest of the blood of the bull at the base of the altar for burnt offerings, which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"8 He will cut away all the fat of the bull of the sin offering; the fat that covers the inner parts, all the fat that is attached to the inner parts, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"9 the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the lobe of the liver, with the kidneys—he will cut away all this. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"10 He will cut it all away, just as he cuts it off from the bull of the sacrifice of peace offerings. Then the priest will burn these parts on the altar for burnt offerings. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"11 The skin of the bull and any remaining meat, with its head and with its legs and its inner parts and its dung, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"12 all the rest of the parts of the bull—he will carry all these parts outside the camp to a place that they have cleansed for me, where they pour out the ashes; they will burn those parts there on wood. They must burn those parts where they pour out the ashes. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"13 If the whole assembly of Israel sins without wanting to sin, and the assembly is unaware that they have sinned and done any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and if they are guilty, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"14 then, when the sin they have committed becomes known, then the assembly must offer a young bull for a sin offering and bring it before the tent of meeting. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"15 The elders of the assembly will lay their hands on the head of the bull before Yahweh, and the bull will be killed before Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"16 The anointed priest will bring some of the blood of the bull to the tent of meeting, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"17 and the priest will dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before Yahweh, before the curtain. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"18 He will put some of the blood on the horns of the altar that is before Yahweh, which is in the tent of meeting, and he will pour out all the blood at the base of the altar for burnt offerings, which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,19 He will cut off all the fat from it and burn it on the altar. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"20 That is what he must do with the bull. Just as he did with the bull of the sin offering, so will he also do with this bull, and the priest will make atonement for the people, and they will be forgiven. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,21 He will carry the bull outside the camp and burn it as he burned the first bull. This is the sin offering for the assembly. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"22 When a ruler sins without intending to sin, doing any one of all the things that Yahweh his God has commanded not to be done, and he is guilty, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"23 then his sin which he has committed is made known to him, he must bring for his sacrifice a goat, a male without blemish. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,24 He will lay his hand on the head of the goat and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before Yahweh. This is a sin offering. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"25 The priest will take the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar for burnt offerings, and he will pour out its blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"26 He will burn all the fat on the altar, just like the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings. The priest will make atonement for the ruler concerning his sin, and the ruler will be forgiven. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"27 If anyone of the common people sins without intending to sin, doing any of the things which Yahweh has commanded him not to be done, and when he realizes his guilt, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"28 then his sin which he has committed is made known to him, then he will bring a goat for his sacrifice, a female without blemish, for the sin that he has committed. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,29 He will lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and kill the sin offering at the place of burnt offering. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,30 The priest will take some of the blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar for burnt offerings. He will pour out all the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"31 He will cut away all the fat, just as the fat is cut away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings. The priest will burn it on the altar to produce a sweet aroma for Yahweh. The priest will make atonement for the man, and he will be forgiven. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"32 If the man brings a lamb as his sacrifice for a sin offering, he will bring a female without blemish. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,33 He will lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and kill it for a sin offering at the place where they kill the burnt offering. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"34 The priest will take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar for burnt offerings, and he will pour out all its blood at the base of the altar. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,4,"35 He will cut away all the fat, just as the fat of the lamb is cut away from the sacrifice of peace offerings, and the priest will burn it on the altar on top of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire. The priest will make atonement for him for the sin he has committed, and the man will be forgiven. 5 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,5,"1 If anyone sins because he does not testify when he has witnessed something about which he is required to testify, whether he has seen it or heard about it, he will be responsible. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,5,"2 Or if anyone touches anything God has designated as unclean, whether it be the carcass of an unclean wild animal or the carcass of any livestock that has died, or creeping animal, even if the person did not intend to touch it, he is unclean and guilty. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,5,"3 Or if he touches the uncleanness of someone, whatever that uncleanness is, and if he is unaware of it, then he will be guilty when he learns about it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,5,"4 Or if anyone swears rashly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatever it is that a man swears rashly with an oath, even if he is unaware of it, when he learns about it, then he will be guilty, in any of these things. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,5,"5 When someone is guilty in any of these things, he must confess whatever sin he has committed. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,5,"6 Then he must bring his guilt offering to Yahweh for the sin that he has committed, a female animal from the flock, either a lamb or a goat, for a sin offering, and the priest will make atonement for him concerning his sin. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,5,"7 If he cannot afford to buy a lamb, then he can bring as his guilt offering for his sin two doves or two young pigeons to Yahweh, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,5,"8 He must bring them to the priest, who will offer one for the sin offering first—he will wring off its head from its neck but will not remove it completely from the body. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,5,"9 Then he will sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, and he will drain the rest of the blood out at the base of the altar. This is a sin offering. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,5,"10 Then he must offer the second bird as a burnt offering, as described in the instructions, and the priest will make atonement for him for the sin that he has committed, and the personwill be forgiven."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,5,"11 But if he cannot afford to buy two doves or two young pigeons, then he must bring as his sacrifice for his sin a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering. He must not put oil or any incense on it, for it is a sin offering. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,5,"12 He must bring it to the priest, and the priest will take a handful of it as a representative offering and then burn it on the altar, on top of the offerings made by fire for Yahweh. This is a sin offering. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,5,"13 The priest will make atonement for any sin that the person has committed, and that person will be forgiven. The leftovers from the offering will belong to the priest, as with the grain offering.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,5,"14 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,5,"15 “If anyone sins and acts unfaithfully in regard to the things that belong to Yahweh, but did so unintentionally, then he must bring his guilt offering to Yahweh. This offering must be a ram without blemish from the flock; its value must be appraised in silver shekels—the shekel of the sanctuary—as a guilt offering. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,5,"16 He must satisfy Yahweh for what he had done wrong in connection with what is holy, and he must add one-fifth to it and give it to the priest. Then the priest will make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and that person will be forgiven. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,5,"17 If anyone sins and does anything that Yahweh has commanded not to be done, even if he was unaware of it, he is still guilty and must carry his own guilt. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,5,"18 He must bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, worth the current value, as a guilt offering to the priest. Then the priest will make atonement for him concerning the sin he has committed, of which he was unaware, and he will be forgiven. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,5,"19 It is a guilt offering, and he is certainly guilty before Yahweh.” 6 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,"1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,"2 “If anyone sins and acts unfaithfully against Yahweh by deceiving his neighbor regarding something held in trust, or was left in his care, or about something that was stolen, or if he has oppressed his neighbor, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,"3 or he has found something that his neighbor lost and lies about it, or if he swears falsely, or in any matters like these by which people sin, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,"4 and if he has sinned and is found to be guilty, he must restore whatever he took by robbery or oppression, or that which was entrusted to him, or that which was lost but that he had found. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,"5 In addition, in any matter in which he swore falsely, he must restore it in full and he must add one-fifth of the value of it and pay it all to the owner on the day that he is found guilty. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,"6 Then he must bring his guilt offering to Yahweh, a ram without blemish from the flock that is worth the current value, as a guilt offering to the priest. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,"7 The priest will make atonement for him before Yahweh, and he will be forgiven concerning whatever he has become guilty of doing.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,"8 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,"9 “Command Aaron and his sons, saying, 'This is the law of the burnt offering The burnt offering must be on the hearth of the altar all night until morning, and the fire of the altar will be kept burning. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,"10 The priest will put on his linen clothes, and he will also put on his linen underclothes. He will pick up the ashes that are left after the fire has consumed the burnt offering on the altar, and he will put the ashes beside the altar. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,11 He will take off his garments and put on other garments to carry the ashes outside the camp to a place that is clean. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,"12 The fire on the altar will be kept burning. It must not go out, and the priest will burn wood on it every morning. He will arrange the burnt offering as required on it, and he will burn on it the fat of the peace offerings. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,13 Fire must be kept burning on the altar continually. It must not go out. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,14 This is the law of the grain offering. The sons of Aaron will offer it before Yahweh before the altar. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,"15 The priest will take up a handful of the fine flour of the grain offering and of the oil and the incense which is on the grain offering, and he will burn it on the altar to produce a sweet aroma as a representative offering. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,16 Aaron and his sons will eat whatever is left of the offering. It must be eaten without yeast in a holy place. They will eat it in the courtyard of the tent of meeting. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,"17 It must not be baked with yeast. I have given it as their part of my offerings made by fire. It is most holy, as the sin offering and the guilt offering. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,"18 For all time to come throughout your people's generations, any male descended from Aaron may eat it as his share, taken from the offerings of Yahweh made by fire. Whoever touches them will become holy.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,"19 So Yahweh spoke to Moses again, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,"20 “This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they will offer to Yahweh on the day when each son is anointed a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,"21 It will be made with oil in a baking pan. When it is soaked, you will bring it in. In baked pieces you will offer the grain offering to produce a sweet aroma for Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,"22 The son of the high priest who is becoming the new high priest from among his sons will offer it. As commanded forever, all of it shall be burned to Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,23 Every grain offering of the priest will be completely burned up. It must not be eaten.” 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,"24 Yahweh spoke to Moses again, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,"25 “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, 'This is the law of the sin offering The sin offering must be killed at the place where the burnt offering is killed before Yahweh. It is most holy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,26 The priest who offers it for sin will eat it. It must be eaten in a holy place in the courtyard of the tent of meeting. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,"27 Whatever touches its meat will become holy, and if the blood is sprinkled on any garment, you must wash it, the part that was sprinkled on, in a holy place. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,"28 But the clay pot in which it is boiled must be broken. If it is boiled in a bronze pot, it must be scrubbed and rinsed clean in water. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,29 Any male among the priests may eat some of it because it is most holy. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,6,30 But any sin offering whose blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place must not be eaten. It must be burned. 7 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,1 This is the law of the guilt offering. It is most holy. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"2 They must kill the guilt offering in the place for killing it, and they must sprinkle its blood against every side of the altar. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"3 All the fat in it will be offered the fat tail, the fat that is over the inner parts, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"4 the two kidneys and the fat on them, which is next to the loins, and what covers the liver, with the kidneys—all this must be removed. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,5 The priest must burn these parts on the altar as an offering made with fire to Yahweh. This is the guilt offering. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,6 Every male among the priests may eat part of this offering. It must be eaten in a holy place because it is most holy. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,7 The sin offering is like the guilt offering. The same law applies to both of them. They belong to the priest who makes atonement with them. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,8 The priest who offers anyone's burnt offering may have for himself the hide of that offering. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"9 Every grain offering that is baked in an oven, and every such offering that is cooked in a frying pan or in a baking pan will belong to the priest who offers it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"10 Every grain offering, either dry or mixed with oil, will belong equally to all the descendants of Aaron. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,11 This is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings which people will offer to Yahweh. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"12 If anyone offers it in order to give thanks, then he must offer it with a sacrifice of cakes made without yeast, but mixed with oil, of cakes madewithout yeast, but spread with oil, and of cakes made with fine flour that is mixedwith oil. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"13 Also for the purpose of giving thanks, he must offer with his peace offering cakes of bread made with yeast. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,14 He is to offer one of each kind of these sacrifices as an offering presented to Yahweh. It will belong to the priests who sprinkle the blood of the peace offerings onto the altar. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,15 The person presenting a peace offering for the purpose of giving thanks must eat the meat of his offering on the day of the sacrifice. He must not leave any of it until the next morning. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"16 But if the sacrifice of his offering is for the purpose of a vow, or for the purpose of a freewill offering, the meat must be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice, but whatever remains of it may be eaten on the next day. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"17 However, whatever meat of the sacrifice remains on the third day must be burned. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"18 If any of the meat of the sacrifice of one's peace offering is eaten on the third day, it will not be accepted, neither will it be credited to the one who offered it. It will be a disgusting thing, and the person who eats it will carry the guilt of his sin. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"19 Any meat that touches an unclean thing must not be eaten. It must be burned. As for the rest of the meat, anyone who is clean may eat it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"20 However, an unclean person who eats any meat from the sacrifice of a peace offering that belongs to Yahweh—that person must be cut off from his people. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"21 If anyone touches any unclean thing—whether uncleanness of man, or of unclean beast, or of some unclean and disgusting thing, and if he then eats some of the meat of a sacrifice of peace offering that belongs to Yahweh, that person must be cut off from his people.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"22 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"23 “Speak to the people of Israel and say, 'You must eat no fat of an ox or a sheep or a goat. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"24 The fat of an animal that died without being a sacrifice, or the fat of an animal torn by wild animals, may be used for other purposes, but you must certainly not eat it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"25 Whoever eats the fat of an animal that men can offer as a sacrifice by fire to Yahweh, that person must be cut off from his people. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"26 You must eat no blood whatsoever in any of your houses, whether it is from a bird or an animal. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"27 Whoever eats any blood, that person must be cut off from his people.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"28 So Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"29 “Speak to the people of Israel and say, 'He who offers the sacrifice of a peace offering to Yahweh must bring part of his sacrifice to Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"30 The offering for Yahweh to be made by fire, his own hands must bring it. He must bring the fat with the breast, so that the breast may be waved as a wave offering before Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"31 The priest must burn the fat on the altar, but the breast will belong to Aaron and his descendants. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,32 You must give the right thigh to the priest as an offering presented out of the sacrifice of your peace offerings. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"33 The priest, one of Aaron's descendants, who offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat—he will have the right thigh as his share of the offering. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"34 For I have taken from the people of Israel, the breast of the wave offering, and the thigh that is the contribution, and they have been given to Aaron the priest and his sons as their regular share. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"35 This is the share for Aaron and his descendants from the offerings for Yahweh made by fire, on the day when Moses presented them to serve Yahweh in the work of priest. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"36 This is the share that Yahweh commanded to be given them from the people of Israel, on the day that he anointed the priests. It will always be their share throughout all generations."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,"37 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the grain offering, of the sin offering, of the guilt offering, of the consecration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,7,38 about which Yahweh gave commands to Moses on Mount Sinai on the day that he commanded the people of Israel to offer their sacrifices to Yahweh in the wilderness of Sinai.'” 8 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"2 “Take Aaron and his sons with him, the garments and the anointing oil, the bull for the sin offering, the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,3 Assemble all the assembly at the entrance to the tent of meeting.” 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"4 So Moses did as Yahweh commanded him, and the assembly came together at the entrance to the tent of meeting. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"5 Then Moses said to the assembly, “This is what Yahweh has commanded to be done.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,6 Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"7 He put on Aaron the tunic and tied the sash around his waist, clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him, and then he tied the ephod around him with the finely- woven waistband and bound it to him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"8 He placed the breastpiece on him, and in the breastpiece he put the Urim and the Thummim. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"9 He set the turban on his head, and on the turban, in front, he set the golden plate, the holy crown, as Yahweh had commanded him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"10 Moses took the anointing oil, anointed the tabernacle and everything in it and set them apart to Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"11 He sprinkled the oil on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the washbasin and its base, to set them apart to Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,12 He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed him to set him apart. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"13 Moses brought Aaron's sons and clothed them with tunics. He tied sashes around their waists and wrapped linen cloth around their heads, as Yahweh had commanded him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"14 Moses brought the bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull that they had brought for the sin offering. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"15 He killed it, and he took the blood and put it on the horns of the altar with his finger, purified the altar, poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and set it apart for God in order to make atonement for it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"16 He took all the fat that was on the inner parts, the covering of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, and Moses burned it all on the altar. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"17 But the bull, its hide, its meat, and its dung he burned outside the camp, as Yahweh had commanded him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"18 Moses presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,19 He killed it and sprinkled its blood against every side of the altar. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,20 He cut the ram into pieces and burned the head and the pieces and the fat. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"21 He washed the inner parts and the legs with water, and he burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering and produced a sweet aroma, an offering made by fire to Yahweh as Yahweh had commanded Moses. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"22 Then Moses presented the other ram, the ram of consecration, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"23 Aaron killed it, and Moses took some of its blood and put it on the tip of Aaron's right ear, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"24 He brought Aaron's sons, and he put some of the blood on the tip of their right ear, on the thumb of their right hand, and on the big toe of their right foot. Then Moses sprinkled its blood against every side of the altar. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"25 He took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat that was on the inner parts, the covering of the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"26 Out of the basket of bread without yeast that was before Yahweh, he took one loaf without yeast, and one loaf of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat and on the right thigh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,27 He put it all in the hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons and waved them before Yahweh as a wave offering. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,28 Then Moses took them from off their hands and burned them on the altar for the burnt offering. They were a consecration offering and produced a sweet aroma. It was an offering made by fire to Yahweh. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"29 Moses took the breast and waved it as a wave offering to Yahweh. It was Moses' share of the ram for the priests' ordination, as Yahweh had commanded him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"30 Moses took some of the anointing oil and the blood that was on the altar; he sprinkled these on Aaron, on his clothes, on his sons, and on his sons' clothes with him. In this way he set apart Aaron and his clothes, and his sons and their clothes to Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"31 So Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, “Boil the meat at the entrance to the tent of meeting, and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, 'Aaron and his sons will eat it.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,32 Whatever remains of the meat and of the bread you must burn. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"33 You must not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are fulfilled. For Yahweh will consecrate you for seven days. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,34 What has been done this day— Yahweh has commanded to be done to make atonement for you. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,"35 You will stay day and night for seven days at the entrance to the tent of meeting, and keep the command of Yahweh, so you will not die, because this is what I have been commanded.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,8,36 So Aaron and his sons did all the things which Yahweh had commanded them through Moses. 9 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,1 On the eighth day Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,"2 He said to Aaron, “Take a calf from the herd for a sin offering, and a ram without blemish for a burnt offering, and offer them before Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,"3 You must speak to the people of Israel and say, 'Take a male goat for a sin offering and a calf and a lamb, both a year old and without blemish, for a burnt offering; "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,"4 also take an ox and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice before Yahweh, and a grain offering mixed with oil, because today Yahweh will appear to you.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,"5 So they brought all that Moses commanded to the tent of meeting, and all the assembly of Israel approached and stood before Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,"6 Then Moses said, “This is what Yahweh commanded you to do, so that his glory may appear to you.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,"7 Moses said to Aaron, “Come near the altar and offer your sin offering and burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and for the people, and offer the sacrifice for the people to make atonement for them, as Yahweh has commanded.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,"8 So Aaron went near the altar and killed the calf for the sin offering, which was for himself. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,"9 The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger into it and put it on the horns of the altar; then he poured out the blood at the base of the altar. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,"10 However, he burned the fat, the kidneys, and the covering of the liver on the altar as a sin offering, as Yahweh had commanded Moses. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,11 The meat and the hide he burned outside the camp. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,"12 Aaron killed the burnt offering, and his sons gave him the blood, which he splashed against every side of the altar. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,"13 Then they gave him the burnt offering, piece by piece, together with the head, and he burned them on the altar. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,14 He washed the inner parts and the legs and burned them on top of the burnt offering on the altar. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,"15 Aaron presented the people's sacrifice—a goat, then took it as the sacrifice for their sin and killed it; he sacrificed it for sin, as he had done with the first goat. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,16 He presented the burnt offering and offered it as Yahweh had commanded.
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,"17 He presented the grain offering; he filled his hand with it and burned it on the altar, along with the morning's burnt offering. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,"18 He killed also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice for the peace offering, which was for the people. Aaron's sons gave him the blood, which he sprinkled against every side of the altar. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,"19 However, they cut out the fat of the bull and the ram, the fat tail, the fat that covers the inner parts, the kidneys, and the covering of the liver. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,"20 They took the parts that were cut out and put these on the breasts, and then Aaron burned the fat on the altar. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,"21 Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh as a wave offering before Yahweh, as Moses had commanded. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,"22 Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them; then he came down from offering the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offering. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,"23 Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, then came out again and blessed the people, and the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the people. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,9,"24 Fire came out from Yahweh and consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar. When all the people saw this, they shouted and lay facedown. 10 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,10,"1 Nadab and Abihu, sons of Aaron, each took his censer, put fire in it, and then incense. Then they offered unapproved fire before Yahweh, which he had not commanded them to offer. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,10,"2 So fire came out from before Yahweh and devoured them, and they died before Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,10,"3 Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what Yahweh was talking about when he said, 'I will reveal my holiness to those who come near me. I will be glorified before all the people.'” Aaron did not say anything. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,10,"4 Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, “Come here and carry your brothers out of the camp from before the tabernacle.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,10,"5 So they came near and carried them, still wearing their priestly tunics, out of the camp, as Moses had instructed. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,10,"6 Then Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, “Do not let your hair on your heads hang loosely, and do not tear your clothes, so that you may not die, and so that Yahweh may not be angry with all the assembly. But allow your relatives, the entire house of Israel, to mourn for those whom the fire of Yahweh has set ablaze. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,10,"7 You must not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting, or you will die, for the anointing oil of Yahweh is on you.” So they acted according to Moses' instructions. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,10,"8 Yahweh spoke to Aaron, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,10,"9 “Do not drink wine or strong drink, you, or your sons who remain with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, so you will not die. This will be a permanent statute throughout your people's generations, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,10,"10 to distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,10,11 so that you may teach the people of Israel all the statutes that Yahweh has commanded through Moses.” 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,10,"12 Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his remaining sons, “Take the grain offering that remains from the offerings to Yahweh made by fire, and eat it without yeast beside the altar, for it is most holy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,10,"13 You must eat it in a holy place, because it is your share and your sons' share of the offerings to Yahweh made by fire, for this is what I have been commanded to tell you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,10,"14 The breast that is waved and the thigh that is presented to Yahweh, you must eat in a clean place acceptable to God. You and your sons and daughters with you should eat those portions, for they are given as your share and your sons' share out of the sacrifices of the fellowship offerings of the people of Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,10,"15 The thigh that is presented and the breast that is waved, they must bring with the offerings of fat made by fire, to wave before Yahweh. They will be yours and your sons' withyou as a share forever, as Yahweh has commanded.”"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,10,"16 Then Moses asked about the goat for the sin offering, and found that it was burned up. So he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the remaining sons of Aaron; he said, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,10,"17 “Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the area of the tabernacle, since it is most holy, and since Yahweh has given it to you to take away the iniquity of the assembly, to make atonement for them before him? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,10,"18 Look, its blood was not brought inside the tabernacle, so you should certainly have eaten it in the tabernacle area, as I commanded.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,10,"19 Then Aaron answered Moses, “See, today they made their sin offering and burnt offering before Yahweh, and this thing has happened to me today. If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been pleasing in the sight of Yahweh?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,10,"20 When Moses heard that, he was satisfied. 11 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"2 “Speak to the people of Israel, saying, 'These are the living things which you may eat among all the animals that are on the earth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,3 You may eat any animal that has a split hoof and that also chews the cud. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"4 However, some animals either chew the cud or have a split hoof, and you must not eat them, animals such as the camel, because it chews the cud but does not have a split hoof. So the camel is unclean to you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"5 Also the rock badger, because it chews the cud but does not have a split hoof, it is also unclean to you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"6 The rabbit, because it chews the cud, but does not have a split hoof, is unclean to you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"7 The pig, although it has a split hoof, does not chew the cud, is unclean to you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"8 You must not eat any of their meat, nor touch their carcasses. They are unclean to you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"9 The animals living in the water that you may eat are all those that have fins and scales, whether in the ocean or in the rivers. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"10 But all living creatures that do not have fins and scales in the ocean or rivers, including all that move in the water and all the living creatures that are in the water— they must be detested by you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"11 Since they must be detested, you must not eat of their meat; also, their carcasses must be detested. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,12 Whatever has no fins or scales in the water must be detested by you. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"13 The birds you must detest and that you must not eat are these the eagle, the vulture, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"14 the kite, any kind of falcon, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"15 every kind of raven, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"16 the horned owl and the screech owl, the seagull, and any kind of hawk. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"17 You must also detest the little owl and the great owl, the cormorant, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"18 the white owl and the barn owl, the osprey, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"19 the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe, and also the bat. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,20 All winged insects that walk on four legs are detestable to you. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,21 Yet you may eat any of the flying insects that also walk on four legs if they have jointed legs for hopping on the ground. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"22 You may also eat any kind of locust, katydid, cricket, or grasshopper. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,23 But all the flying insects that have four feet must be detested by you. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,24 You will become unclean until evening by these animals if you touch a carcass of one of them. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,25 Whoever picks up one of their carcasses must wash his clothes and remain unclean until evening. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,26 Every animal which has a split hoof that is not completely divided or which does not chew the cud is unclean to you. Everyone who touches them will be unclean. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"27 Whatever walks on its paws among all the animals that walk on all four legs, they are unclean to you. Whoever touches such a carcass will be unclean until the evening. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,28 Whoever picks up such a carcass must wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening. Theseanimals will be unclean to you.
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"29 Of the animals that creep on the ground, these are the animals that will be unclean to you the weasel, the rat, every kind of large lizard, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"30 the gecko, the monitor lizard, the lizard, the skink, and the chameleon. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"31 Of all the animals that creep, these are the animals which will be unclean to you. Whoever touches them when they are dead will be unclean until evening. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"32 If any of them dies and falls on anything, that thing will be unclean, whether it is made of wood, cloth, leather, or sackcloth. Whatever it is and whatever it is used for, it must be put into water; it will be unclean until evening. Then it will be clean. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"33 For every clay pot into or onto which any unclean animal falls, whatever is in the pot will become unclean, and you must destroy that pot. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,34 Any food that could be eaten but has water on it from such a pot is unclean. Any liquid that is for drinking from such a pot is unclean. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"35 Anything that one of their carcasses falls on becomes unclean; if it is an oven or small stove, it must be broken to pieces. They are unclean and they must remain unclean to you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,36 A spring or cistern for collecting water remains clean; but anyone who touches their carcass is unclean. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"37 If any part of their carcass falls upon any seeds for planting, those seeds will still be clean. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"38 But if water is put on the seeds, and if any part of their carcass falls on them, then they will be unclean to you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"39 If any animal that you may eat dies, then he who touches the carcass will be unclean until evening. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,40 Whoever eats any of that carcass must wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. Anyone who picks up such a carcass will wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,41 Every animal that creeps on the ground is to be detested; it must not be eaten. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"42 Whatever crawls on its belly, and whatever walks on all four legs, or whatever has many feet—all the animals that creep on the ground, these you must not eat, for they are to be detested. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"43 You must not make yourselves unclean with any living creatures that creep; you must not make yourselves unclean with them, that you should be made impure by them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"44 For I am Yahweh your God. You are to keep yourselves holy, therefore, and be holy, because I am holy. You must not defile yourselves with any kind of animal that moves about on the ground. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"45 For I am Yahweh, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. You must therefore be holy, for I am holy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"46 This is the law regarding the animals, the birds, every living creature that moves in the waters, and of every creature that creeps on the ground, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,11,"47 for which a distinction is to be made between the unclean and the clean, and between the living things that may be eaten and the living things that may not be eaten.'” 12 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,12,"1 Yahweh said to Moses, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,12,"2 “Speak to the people of Israel, saying, 'If a woman conceives and gives birth to a male child, then she will be unclean for seven days, just as she is unclean during the days of her monthly period. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,12,3 On the eighth day the flesh of a baby boy's foreskin must be circumcised. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,12,4 Then the mother's purification from her bleeding will continue for thirty-three days. She must not touch any holy thing or come into the tabernacle area until the days of her purification are finished. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,12,"5 But if she gives birth to a female child, then she will be unclean for two weeks, as she is during her period. Then the mother's purification will continue for sixty-six days. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,12,"6 When the days of her purification are finished, for a son or for a daughter, she must bring a one year old lamb as a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or dove as a sin offering, to the entrance of the tent of meeting, to the priest. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,12,"7 Then he will offer it before Yahweh and make atonement for her, and she will be cleansed from the flow of her blood. This is the law regarding a woman who gives birth to either a male or a female child. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,12,"8 If she is not able to afford a lamb, then she must take two doves or two young pigeons, one as a burnt offering and the other as a sin offering, and the priest will make atonement for her; then she will be clean.'” 13 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"2 “When anyone has on the skin of his body a swelling or scab or a bright spot, and it becomes infected and there is a skin disease in his body, then he must be brought to Aaron the high priest, or to one of his sons the priests. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"3 Then the priest will examine the disease in the skin of his body. If the hair in the diseased area has turned white, and if the disease appears to be deeper than just on the skin, then it is an infectious disease. After the priest examines him, he must pronounce him unclean. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"4 If the bright spot in his skin is white, and the appearance of it is no deeper than the skin, and if the hair in the diseased area has not turned white, then the priest must isolate the one with the disease for seven days. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"5 On the seventh day, the priest must examine him to see if in his opinion the disease is not any worse, and if it has not spread in the skin. If it has not, then the priest must isolate him seven days more. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"6 The priest will examine him again on the seventh day to see if the disease is better and has not spread farther in the skin. If it has not, then the priest will pronounce him clean. It is a rash. He must wash his clothes, and then he is clean. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"7 But if the rash has spread in the skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he must then show himself to the priest again. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"8 The priest will examine him to see if the rash has spread farther in the skin. If it has spread, then the priest must pronounce him unclean. It is an infectious disease. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"9 When an infectious skin disease is in someone, then he must be brought to the priest. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"10 The priest will examine him to see if there is a white swelling in the skin, if the hair has turned white, or if there is raw flesh in the swelling. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"11 If there is, then it is a chronic skin disease, and the priest must pronounce him unclean. He will not isolate him, because he is already unclean. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"12 If the disease breaks out widely in the skin and covers all the skin of the person with the disease from his head to his feet, as far as it appears to the priest, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"13 then the priest must examine him to see if the disease has covered all his body. If it has, then the priest must pronounce the person who has the disease as clean. If it has all turned white, then he is clean. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"14 But if raw flesh appears on him, he will be unclean. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,15 The priest must look at the raw flesh and pronounce him unclean because the raw flesh is unclean. It is an infectious disease. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"16 But if the raw flesh turns white again, then the person must go to the priest. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,17 The priest will examine him to see if the flesh has turned white. If it has then the priest will pronounce that person to be clean. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"18 When a person has a boil on the skin and it has healed, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"19 and in place of the boil there is white swelling or a bright spot, reddish-white, then it must be shown to the priest. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"20 The priest will examine it to see if it appears deeper under the skin, and if the hair there has turned white. If so, then the priest must pronounce him unclean. It is an infectious disease, if it has developed in the place where the boil was. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"21 But if the priest examines it and sees that there is no white hair in it, and that it is not under the skin but has faded, then the priest must isolate him for seven days. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"22 If it spreads widely in the skin, then the priest must pronounce him unclean. It is an infectious disease. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"23 But if the bright spot stays in its place and has not spread, then it is the scar of the boil, and the priest must pronouncehim clean."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"24 When the skin has a burn and the raw flesh of the burn has become a reddish- white or white spot, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"25 then the priest will examine it to see if the hair in that spot has turned white, and if it appears to be deeper than the skin. If it has, then it is an infectious disease. It has broken out in the burn, and the priest must pronounce him unclean. It is an infectious disease. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"26 But if the priest examines it and finds that there is no white hair in the spot, and it is not under the skin but has faded, then the priest must isolate him for seven days. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"27 Then the priest must examine him on the seventh day. If it has spread widely in the skin, then the priest must pronounce him unclean. It is an infectious disease. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"28 If the spot stays in its place and has not spread in the skin but has faded, then it is a swelling from the burn, and the priest must pronounce him clean, for it is nothing more than the scar of the burn. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"29 If a man or woman has an infectious disease on the head or chin, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"30 then the priest must examine the person for an infectious disease to see if it appears to be deeper than the skin, and if there is yellow, thin hair in it. If there is, then the priest must pronounce him unclean. It is an itch, an infectious disease on the head or the chin. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"31 If the priest examines the itching disease and sees that it is not under the skin, and if there is no black hair in it, then the priest will isolate the person with the itching disease for seven days. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"32 On the seventh day the priest will examine the disease to see if it has spread. If there is no yellow hair, and if the disease appears to be only skin deep, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"33 then he must be shaved, but the diseased area must not be shaved, and the priest must isolate the person with the itching disease for seven more days. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"34 On the seventh day the priest will examine the disease to see if it has stopped spreading in the skin. If it appears to be no deeper than the skin, then the priest must pronounce him clean. The person must wash his clothes, and then he will be clean. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"35 But if the itching disease has spread widely in the skin after the priest said he was clean, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"36 then the priest must examine him again. If the disease has spread in the skin, the priest does not need to seek for yellow hair. The person is unclean. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"37 But if in the priest's view the itching disease has stopped spreading and black hair has grown in the area, then the disease has healed. He is clean, and the priest must pronounce him clean. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"38 If a man or a woman has white spots on the skin, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"39 then the priest must examine the person to see if the spots are a dull white, which is only a rash that has broken out in the skin. He is clean. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"40 If a man's hair has fallen out of his head, he is bald, but he is clean. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"41 If his hair has fallen out of the front part of his head, and if his forehead is bald, he is clean. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,13,"42 But if there is a reddish-white sore on his bald head or forehead, it is an infectious disease that has broken out. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,18,18 You must not marry your wife's sister as a second wife and sleep with her while your first wife is alive. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,18,19 Do not sleep with a woman during her menstruation. She is unclean during that time.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,18,22 Do not sleep with other men as with a woman. This would be wicked. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,18,23 Do not sleep with any animal and defile yourself with it. No woman must consider sleeping with any animal. This would be perversion. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,18,"24 Do not defile yourselves in any of these ways, for in all these ways the nations are defiled, the nations that I will drive out from before you. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,19,21 A man must bring his guilt offering to Yahweh to the entrance to the tent of meeting—a ram as a guilt offering.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,20,"4 If the people of the land close their eyes to that man when he gives any of his children to Molech, if they do not put him to death, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,20,"5 then I myself will set my face against that man and his clan, and I will cut him off and everyone else who prostitutes himself in order to play the harlot with Molech. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,20,"6 The person who turns to those who talk with the dead, or to those who talk with spirits so as to prostitute themselves with them, I will set my face against that person; I will cut him off from among his people. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,20,"7 Therefore consecrate yourselves and be holy, because I am Yahweh your God. * "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,20,8 You must keep my commands and carry them out. I am Yahweh who sets you apart as holy.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,20,"10 The man who commits adultery with another man's wife, that is, anyone who commits adultery with his neighbor's wife—the adulterer and the adulteress must both certainly be put to death. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,20,"16 If a woman approaches any animal to sleep with it, you must kill the woman and the animal. They must certainly be put to death. They are guilty and deserve to die. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,20,"17 If a man sleeps with his sister, a daughter of his father or a daughter of his mother, and he uncovers her nakedness, and she sees his nakedness, it is a shameful thing. They must be cut off from the presence of their people, because he has slept with his sister. He must carry his guilt. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,20,"18 If a man sleeps with a woman during her menstrual period and has slept with her, he has uncovered the flow of her blood, the source of her blood. Both the man and woman must be cut off from among their people. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,20,"19 You must not sleep with your mother's sister, or with your father's sister, because you would disgrace your close relative. You must carry your own guilt. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,20,"21 If a man marries his brother's wife while his brother is still living, that is disgraceful. He has dishonored his brother, and I will take away from their children any property they may have inherited from their parents. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,20,22 You must therefore keep all my statutes and all my decrees; you must obey them so that the land into which I am bringing you to live will not vomit you up.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,21,4 But he must not make himself unclean for other relatives and so defile himself. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,21,"5 Priests must not shave their heads or shave off the corners of their beards, nor cut their bodies. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,21,"6 They must be holy to their God and not disgrace the name of their God, because the priests offer Yahweh's food offerings, the bread of their God. Therefore the priests must be holy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,21,"7 They must not marry any woman who is a prostitute and who is defiled, and they must not marry a woman divorced from her husband, for they are separate for their God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,21,"8 You will set him apart, for he is the one who offers bread to your God. He must be holy to you, because I, Yahweh who makes you holy, am holy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,21,9 Any daughter of any priest who defiles herself by becoming a prostitute disgraces her father. She must be burned. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,21,"10 The one who is the high priest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil has been poured, and who has been consecrated to wear the special garments of the high priest, must not wear his hair loose or tear his clothes. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,21,"11 He must not go anywhere that a dead body is present and defile himself, even for his father or his mother. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,21,"12 The high priest must not leave the sanctuary area of the tabernacle or profane the sanctuary of his God, because he has been consecrated as high priest by the anointing oil of his God. I am Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,21,13 The high priest must marry a virgin as his wife. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,21,"14 He must not marry a widow, a divorced woman, or a woman who is a prostitute. He will not marry these kinds of women. He may only marry a virgin from his own people, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,21,"15 so he will not defile his children among his people, for I am Yahweh, who makes him holy.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,21,"16 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,21,"17 “Speak to Aaron and tell him, 'Whoever of your descendants throughout their generations has a bodily defect, he must not approach to offer the food to his God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,21,"18 Any man who has a bodily defect must not approach Yahweh, such as a blind man or a man who is unable to walk, one who is disfigured or deformed, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,21,"19 a man with a crippled hand or foot, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,21,"20 a man who has a hump in his back or is abnormally thin or short, or a man with a defect in his eyes, or with a disease, sore, scabs, or whose testicles have been crushed. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,21,21 No man among the descendants of Aaron the priest with a bodily defect may come near to perform the offerings made by fire for Yahweh. Such a man has a bodily defect; he must not come near to offer the bread of his God. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,21,"22 He may eat the food of his God, whether some of the most holy or some of the holy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,21,"23 However, he must not enter inside the curtain or come near the altar, because he has a bodily defect, so that he does not defile my holy place, for I am Yahweh, who makes them holy.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,21,"24 So Moses spoke these words to Aaron, to his sons, and to all the people of Israel. 22 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"2 “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, tell them to keep away from the holy things of the people of Israel, which they set apart to me. They must not profane my holy name. I am Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"3 Say to them, 'If any of your descendants throughout your generations approaches the holy things that the people of Israel have set apart to Yahweh, while he is unclean, that person must be cut off from before me I am Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"4 None of the descendants of Aaron who has an infectious skin disease, or an infection flowing from his body, may eat any of the sacrifices made to Yahweh until he is clean. Whoever touches anything unclean through contact with the dead, or by contact with a man who has a flow of semen, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"5 or whoever touches any creeping animal that makes him unclean, or any person who makes him unclean, whatever kind of uncleanness it may be— "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"6 then the priest who touches anything unclean will be unclean until evening. He must not eat any of the holy things, unless he has bathed his body in water. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"7 When the sun has set, he will then be clean. After sunset he may eat from the holy things, because they are his food. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"8 He must not eat anything found dead or killed by wild animals, by which he would defile himself. I am Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"9 The priests must follow my instructions, or they will be guilty of sin and could die for profaning me. I am Yahweh who makes them holy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"10 No one outside the priest's family, including guests of a priest or his hired servants, may eat anything that is holy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"11 But if a priest buys any slave with his own money, that slave may eat from the things set apart to Yahweh. The priest's family members and slaves born in his house, they also may eat with him from those things. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"12 If a priest's daughter married someone who is not a priest, she may not eat any of the holy contribution offerings. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"13 But if a priest's daughter is a widow, or divorced, and if she has no child, and if she returns to live in her father's house as in her youth, she may eat from her father's food. But no one who is not in the priestly family may eat from the priest's food. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"14 If a man eats a holy food without knowing it, then he must repay the priest for it; he must add one-fifth to it and give it back to the priest. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"15 The people of Israel must not profane the holy things that they have raised high and presented to Yahweh, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"16 and cause themselves to carry the sin that would make them guilty of eating the holy food, for I am Yahweh who makes them holy.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"17 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"18 “Speak to Aaron and his sons, and to all the people of Israel.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"19 if it is to be accepted, they must offer a male animal without blemish from the cattle, sheep, or goats. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,20 But you must not offer whatever has a blemish. I will not accept it on your behalf. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"21 Whoever offers a sacrifice of fellowship offerings from the herd or the flock to Yahweh to fulfill a vow, or as a freewill offering, it must be unblemished to be accepted. There must be no defect in the animal. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"22 You must not offer animals that are blind, disabled, or maimed, or that have warts, sores, or scabs. You must not offer these to Yahweh as a sacrifice by fire on the altar. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"23 You may present as a freewill offering an ox or a lamb that is deformed or small, but an offeringlike that will not be accepted for a vow."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"24 Do not offer any animal to Yahweh that has bruised, crushed, torn, or cut testicles. Do not do this within your land. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"25 You must not present the bread of your God from the hand of a foreigner. Those animals are deformed and have defects in them, they will not be accepted for you.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"26 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"27 “When a calf or a sheep or a goat is born, it must remain seven days with its mother. Then from the eighth day on, it may be accepted as a sacrifice for an offering made by fire to Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"28 Do not kill a cow or ewe along with its young, both on the same day. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,"29 When you sacrifice a thank offering to Yahweh, you must sacrifice it in an acceptable way. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,22,30 It must be eaten on the same day that it is sacrificed. You must leave none of it until the next morning. I am Yahweh.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,23,"39 Regarding the Festival of Shelters, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruits of the land, you must keep this festival of Yahweh for seven days. The first day will be a solemn rest, and the eighth day will also be a solemn rest. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,23,"40 On the first day you must take the best fruit from the trees, branches of palm trees, and leafy branches of thick trees, and willows from streams, and you will rejoice before Yahweh your God for seven days. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,23,"41 For seven days each year, you must celebrate this festival for Yahweh. This will be a permanent statute throughout your people's generations in all the places where you live. You must celebrate this festival in the seventh month. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,23,"42 You must live in small shelters for seven days. All native-born Israelites must live in small sheltersfor seven days, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,23,"43 so that your descendants, generation after generation, may learn how I made the people of Israel live in such shelters when I led them out of the land of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,23,"44 In this way, Moses announced to the people of Israel the appointed festivals for Yahweh. 24 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,"1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,"2 “Command the people of Israel to bring you pure oil beaten from olives to be used in the lamp, that the light may burn continually. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,"3 Outside the curtain before the covenant decrees in the tent of meeting, Aaron must continually, from evening to morning, keep the lamp lit before Yahweh. This will be a permanent statute throughout your people's generations. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,"4 The high priest must always keep the lamps lit before Yahweh, the lamps on the lampstand of pure gold. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,5 You must take fine flour and bake twelve loaves with it. There must be two- tenths of an ephah in each loaf. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,"6 Then you must set them in two rows, six in a row, on the table of pure gold before Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,7 You must put pure incense along each row of loaves as a representative offering. This incense will be burnt for Yahweh. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,"8 Every Sabbath day the high priest must regularly set out the bread before Yahweh on behalf of the people of Israel, as a sign of an everlasting covenant. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,"9 This offering will be for Aaron and his sons, and they are to eat it in a place that is holy, for it is a portion from the offerings to Yahweh made by fire.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,"10 Now it happened that the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went among the people of Israel. This son of the Israelite woman fought against an Israelite man in the camp. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,"11 The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the name of Yahweh and cursed God, so the people brought him to Moses. His mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, from the tribe of Dan. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,12 They held him in custody until Yahweh himself should declare his will to them. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,"13 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,"14 “Take the man who has cursed God outside the camp. All who heard him must lay their hands on his head, and then the entire assembly must stone him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,"15 You must explain to the people of Israel and say, 'Whoever curses his God must carry his own guilt. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,"16 He who blasphemes the name of Yahweh must surely be put to death. All the assembly must certainly stone him, whether he is a foreigner or a native-born Israelite. If anyone blasphemes the name of Yahweh, he must be put to death. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,"17 If anyone strikes down another human being, he must certainly be put to death. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,"18 If anyone strikes down someone's animal, he must pay it back, life for life. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,"19 If anyone injures his neighbor, it must be done to him as he did to his neighbor "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,"20 fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. As he has caused an injury to a person, so must it also be done to him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,"21 Anyone who kills an animal must pay it back, and anyone who kills a person must be put to death. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,"22 You must have the same law for both the foreigner and the native-born Israelite, for I am Yahweh your God.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,24,"23 So Moses spoke to the people of Israel, and the people brought the man outside the camp, the one who had cursed Yahweh. They stoned him with stones. The people of Israel carried out the command of Yahweh to Moses. 25 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"1 Yahweh spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"2 “Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, 'When you come into the land that I give you, then the land must be made to keep a Sabbath for Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"3 You must plant your field for six years, and for six years you must prune your vineyard and gather the produce."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"4 But in the seventh year, a Sabbath of solemn rest for the land must be observed, a Sabbath for Yahweh. You must not plant your field or prune your vineyard. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"5 You must not conduct an organized harvest of whatever grows by itself, and you must not conduct an organized harvest of whatever grapes grow on your unpruned vines. This will be a year of solemn rest for the land. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"6 Whatever the unworked land grows during the Sabbath year will be food for you. You, your male and female servants, your hired servants and the foreigners who live with you may gather food, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,7 and your livestock and also wild animals may eat whatever the land produces. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"8 You must count off seven Sabbaths of years, that is, seven times seven years, so that there will be seven Sabbaths of years, totaling forty-nine years. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,9 Then you must blow a loud trumpet everywhere on the tenth day of the seventh month. On the Day of Atonement you must blow a trumpet throughout all your land. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"10 You must set apart the fiftieth year to Yahweh and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It will be a Jubilee for you, in which property and slaves must be returned to their families. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"11 The fiftieth year will be a Jubilee for you. You must not plant or conduct an organized harvest. Eat whatever grows by itself, and gather the grapes that grow on the unpruned vines. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"12 For it is a Jubilee, which will be holy for you. You must eat the produce that grows by itself out of the fields. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,13 You must return everyone to his own property in this year of Jubilee. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"14 If you sell any land to your neighbor or buy any land from your neighbor, you must not cheat or wrong each other. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"15 If you buy land from your neighbor, consider the number of years and crops that can be harvested until the next Jubilee. Your neighbor selling the land must consider that also. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"16 A larger number of years until the next Jubilee will increase the value of land, and a smaller number of years until the next Jubilee will decrease the value, because the number of harvests the land will produce for the new owner is related to the number of years before the next Jubilee. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"17 You must not cheat or wrong one another; instead, you must honor your God, for I am Yahweh your God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"18 Therefore you must obey my decrees, keep my laws, and carry them out. Then you will live in the land in safety. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"19 The land will yield its produce, and you will eat your fill and live there in safety. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"20 You might say, “What will we eat during the seventh year? Look, we cannot plant or gather our produce.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"21 I will command my blessing to come upon you in the sixth year, and it will produce harvest enough for three years. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"22 You will plant in the eighth year and continue to eat from the previous years' produce and the stored food. Until the harvest of the ninth year comes in, you will be able to eat from the provisions stored in the previous years. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"23 The land must not be sold to a new permanent owner, because the land is mine. You are all foreigners and temporary residents on my land. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,24 You must observe the right of redemption for all the land that you acquire; you must allow the land to be bought back by the family from whom you bought it. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"25 If your fellow Israelite became poor and for that reason sold some of his property, then his nearest relative may come and buy back the property that he sold to you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"26 If a man has no relative to redeem his property, but if he has prospered and has the ability to redeem it, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,27 then he may calculate the years since the land was sold and repay the balance to the man to whom he sold it. Then he may return to his own property. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"28 But if he is not able to get the land back for himself, then the land he has sold will remain in the ownership of the one who bought it until the year of Jubilee. At the year of Jubilee, the land will be returned to the man whosold it, and the original owner will return to his property."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"29 If a man sells a house in a walled city, then he may buy it back within a whole year after it was sold. For a full year he will have the right of redemption. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"30 If the house is not redeemed within a full year, then the house in the walled city will become the permanent property of the buyer and his descendants. It is not to be returned in the year of Jubilee. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"31 But the houses of the villages that have no wall around them will be considered as the field of the land. They may be redeemed, and they must be returned during the year of Jubilee. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"32 However, the houses owned by the Levites in their cities may be redeemed at any time. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"33 If one of the Levites does not redeem a house he sold, then the house that was sold in the city where it is located must be returned in the year of Jubilee, for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their property among the people of Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,34 But the fields around their cities may not be sold because they are the permanent property of the Levites. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"35 If your fellow countryman becomes poor, so that he can no longer provide for himself, then you must help him as you would help a foreigner or anyone else living as an outsider among you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"36 Do not charge him interest or try to profit from him in any way, but honor your God so that your brother may keep living with you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"37 You must not give him a loan of money and charge interest, nor sell him your food to earn a profit. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"38 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, in order that I might give you the land of Canaan, and that I might be your God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"39 If your fellow countryman has become poor and sells himself to you, you must not make him work like a slave. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,40 Treat him as a hired servant. He must be like someone living temporarily with you. He will serve with you until the year of Jubilee. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"41 Then he will go away from you, he and his children with him, and he will return to his own family and to his fathers' property. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,42 For they are my servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. They will not be sold as slaves. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"43 You must not rule over them harshly, but you must honor your God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"44 As for your male and female slaves, whom you can obtain from the nations who live around you, you may buy slaves from them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"45 You may also buy slaves from the foreigners who are living among you, that is, from their families who are with you, children who have been born in your land. They may become your property. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"46 You may provide such slaves as an inheritance for your children after you, to hold as property, and make them slaves for life, but you must not rule over your brothers among the people of Israel with harshness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"47 If a foreigner or someone living temporarily with you has become wealthy, and if one of your fellow Israelites has become poor and sells himself to that foreigner, or to someone in a foreigner's family, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"48 after your fellow Israelite has been bought, he may be bought back. Someone in his family may redeem him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"49 It might be the person's uncle, or his uncle's son, who redeems him, or anyone who is his close relative from his family. Or, if he has become prosperous, he may redeem himself. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"50 He must bargain with the man who bought him; they must count the years from the year he sold himself to his purchaser until the year of Jubilee. The price of his redemption must be figured in keeping with the rate paid to a hired servant, for the number of years he might continue to work for the one who bought him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"51 If there are still many years until the year of Jubilee, he must pay back as the price for his redemption an amount of money that is in proportion to the number of those years. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"52 If there are only a few years to the year of Jubilee, then he must bargain with his purchaser to reflect the number of years left before the year of Jubilee, and he must pay for his redemption inkeeping with the number of years. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,53 He is to be treated like a man hired year by year. You must make sure he is not treated with harshness. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,"54 If he is not redeemed by these means, then he must serve until the year of Jubilee, he and his children with him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,25,55 To me the people of Israel are servants. They are my servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.'” 26 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"1 “You must make no idols, and you must not lift up a carved figure or a sacred stone pillar, and you must not place any carved stone image in your land to which you bow down, for I am Yahweh your God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,2 You must keep my Sabbaths and honor my sanctuary. I am Yahweh. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"3 If you walk in my laws and keep my commandments and obey them, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"4 then I will give you rain in its season; the land will yield its produce, and the trees of the field will yield their fruit. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"5 Your threshing will continue to the time of the grape harvest, and the grape harvest will extend to the planting season. You will eat your bread to the full and live safely where you make your home in the land. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"6 I will give peace in the land; you will lie down with nothing to make you afraid. I will take the dangerous animals away from the land, and the sword will not pass through your land. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"7 You will chase your enemies, and they will fall before you by the sword. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"8 Five of you will chase away a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand; your enemies will fall before you by the sword. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,9 I will look at you with favor and make you fruitful and multiply you; I will establish my covenant with you. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,10 You will eat food stored a long time. You will have to bring out the stored food because you will need the room for the new harvest. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"11 I will place my tabernacle among you, and I will not detest you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"12 I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be my people. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"13 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, so that you would not be their slaves. I have broken the bars of your yoke and made you to walk standing up straight. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"14 But if you will not listen to me, and will not obey all these commandments, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"15 and if you reject my decrees and detest my laws, so that you will not obey all my commandments, but break my covenant— 16 —if you do these things, then I will do this to you I will inflict terror on you, diseases and fever that will destroy the eyes and will drain away your life. You will plant your seeds for nothing, because your enemies will eat their produce. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"16 —if you do these things, then I will do this to you I will inflict terror on you, diseases and fever that will destroy the eyes and will drain away your life. You will plant your seeds for nothing, because your enemies will eat their produce. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"17 I will set my face against you, and you will be overpowered by your enemies. Men who hate you will rule over you, and you will run away, even when no one is chasing you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"18 If after all this you do not listen to me, then I will punish you seven times as severely for your sins. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,19 I will break your pride in your power. I will make the sky over you like iron and your land like bronze. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"20 Your strength will be used up for nothing, because your land will not produce its harvest, and your trees in the land will not produce their fruit. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"21 If you walk against me and will not listen to me, I will bring seven times more blows on you, in proportion to your sins. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"22 I will send dangerous animals against you, which will steal your children, destroy your cattle, and make you few in number. So your roads will become deserted. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"23 If in spite of these things you still do not accept my correction and you continue to walk in opposition to me, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"24 then I will also walk in opposition to you, and I myself will punish you seven times because of your sins. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"25 I will bring a sword on you that will execute vengeance for breaking the covenant. You will be gathered together inside your cities, and I will send a disease among you there, and then you will be delivered into the hand of your enemy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"26 When I cut off your food supply, ten women will be able to bake your bread in one oven, and they will distribute your bread by weight. You will eat but not be satisfied. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"27 If you do not listen to me despite these things, but continue to walk against me, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"28 then I will walk against you in anger, and I will punish you even seven more times as much for your sins. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,29 You will eat the flesh of your sons; you will eat the flesh of your daughters. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"30 I will destroy your high places, cut down your incense altars, and throw your corpses on the corpses of your idols, and I myself will abhor you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,31 I will turn your cities into ruins and destroy your sanctuaries. I will not be pleased with the aroma of your offerings. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,32 I will devastate the land. Your enemies who will live there will be shocked at the devastation. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"33 I will scatter you among the nations, and I will draw out my sword and follow you. Your land will be abandoned, and your cities will be ruined. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"34 Then the land will enjoy its Sabbaths for as long as it lies abandoned and you are in your enemies' lands. During that time, the land will rest and enjoy its Sabbaths. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"35 As long as it lies abandoned, it will have rest, which will be the rest that it did not have with your Sabbaths, when you lived in it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"36 As for those of you who are left in your enemies' lands, I will send fear into your hearts so that even the sound of a leaf blowing in the wind will startle you, and you will flee as though you were fleeing from the sword. You will fall, even when no one is chasing you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"37 You will stumble over each other as though you were running from the sword, even though no one is chasing you. You will have no power to stand before your enemies. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"38 You will perish among the nations, and your enemies' land will itself devour you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"39 Those who are left among you will waste away in their sins, there in your enemies' lands, and because of their fathers' sins they will waste away as well. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"40 Yet if they confess their sins and their fathers' sin, and their treason by which they were unfaithful to me, and also their walking against me— "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"41 which caused me to turn against them and I brought them into the land of their enemies—if their uncircumcised hearts become humbled, and if they accept the punishment for their sins, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"42 then will I call to mind my covenant with Jacob, my covenant with Isaac, and my covenant with Abraham; also, I will call the land to mind. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"43 The land will be abandoned by them, so it will be pleased with its Sabbaths while it lies abandoned without them. They will have to pay the penalty for their sins because they themselves rejected my decrees and detested my laws. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"44 Yet despite all this, when they are in their enemies' land, I will not reject them, neither will I detest them so as to completely destroy them and do away with my covenant with them, for I am Yahweh their God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"45 But for their sakes I will call to mind the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, so that I might be their God. I am Yahweh.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,26,"46 These are the commandments, decrees, and laws that Yahweh made between himself and the people of Israel at Mount Sinai through Moses. 27 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"2 “Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, 'If anyone makes a special vow to Yahweh, use the following valuations. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"3 Your standard value for a male from twenty to sixty years old must be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,4 For a female of the same ages your standard value must be thirty shekels. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"5 From five years to twenty years old your standard value for a male must be twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"6 From one month old to five years your standard value for a male must be five shekels of silver, and for a female three shekels of silver."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"7 From sixty years old and up for a male your standard value must be fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"8 But if the person making the vow cannot pay the standard value, then the person being given must be presented to the priest, and the priest will value that person by the amount the one making the vow is able to afford. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"9 If someone wants to sacrifice an animal to Yahweh, and if Yahweh accepts it, then that animal will be set apart to him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"10 The person must not alter or change such an animal, a good one for a bad one or a bad for a good. If he does at all change one animal for another, then both it and the one for which it is exchanged become holy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"11 However, if what the person has vowed to give Yahweh is in fact unclean, so that Yahweh will not accept it, then the person must bring the animal to a priest. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"12 The priest will value it, by the market value of the animal. Whatever value the priest places on the animal, that will be its value. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"13 If the owner wishes to redeem it, then a fifth of its value is to be added to its redemption price. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"14 When a man sets apart his house as a holy gift to Yahweh, then the priest will set its value as either good or bad. Whatever the priest values it, so it will be. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"15 But if the owner who set apart his home wishes to redeem it, he must add a fifth of its value to its redemption price, and it will belong to him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"16 If a man sets apart some of his own land, then the valuation of it will be in proportion to the amount of seed required to plant it—a homer of barley will be valued at fifty shekels of silver. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"17 If he sets apart his field during the year of Jubilee, the valuation of it will stand. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"18 But if he sets apart his field after the year of Jubilee, then the priest must calculate the value of the field by the number of years that remain until the next year of Jubilee, and the valuation of it must be reduced. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"19 If the man who set apart the field wishes to redeem it, then he must add a fifth to the valuation, and it will belong to him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"20 If he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it cannot be redeemed any more. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"21 Instead, the field, when it is released in the year of Jubilee, will be a holy gift to Yahweh, like the field that has been completely given to Yahweh. It will belong to the priest. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"22 If a man sets apart a field that he has bought, but that field is not part of his family's land, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"23 then the priest will figure the valuation of it up to the year of Jubilee, and the man must pay its value on that day as a holy gift to Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"24 In the year of Jubilee, the field will return to the man from whom it was bought, to the land's owner. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,25 All the valuations must be set by the weight of the sanctuary shekel. Twenty gerahs must be the equivalent of one shekel. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"26 No one may set apart the firstborn among animals, since the firstborn already belongs to Yahweh; whether ox or sheep, it is Yahweh's. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"27 If it is an unclean animal, then the owner may buy it back at the valuation of it, and a fifth must be added to that value. If the animal is not redeemed, then it is to be sold at the set value. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"28 But nothing that a man devotes to Yahweh, from all that he has, whether human or animal, or his family land, may be sold or redeemed. Everything that is devoted is very holy to Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,29 No ransom may be paid for the person who is devoted for destruction. That person must be put to death. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"30 All the tithe of the land, whether grain grown on the land or fruit from the trees, is Yahweh's. It is holy to Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"31 If a man redeems any of his tithe, he must add a fifth to its value. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"32 As for every tenth of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the shepherd's rod, one-tenth must be set apart to Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,"33 The shepherd must not search for the better or the worse animals, and he must not substitute one for another. If he changes it at all, then both it and that for whichit is changed will be holy. It cannot be redeemed.'”"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Leviticus,27,34 These are the commandments that Yahweh gave at Mount Sinai to Moses for the people of Israel.

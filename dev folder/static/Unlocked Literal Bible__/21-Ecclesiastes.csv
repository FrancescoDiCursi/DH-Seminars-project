Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes, Ecclesiastes,
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,1,"1 These are the words of the Teacher, the descendant of David and king in Jerusalem. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,1,"2 The Teacher says this. “Like a vapor of mist, like a breeze in the wind, everything vanishes, leaving many questions. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,1,3 What profit does mankind gain from all the work that they labor at under the sun? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,1,"4 One generation goes, and another generation comes, but the earth remains forever. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,1,"5 The sun rises, and it goes down and hurries back to the place where it rises again. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,1,"6 The wind blows south and circles around to the north, always going around along its pathway and coming back again. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,1,"7 All the rivers flow into the sea, but the sea is never full. To the place where the rivers go, there they go again. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,1,"8 Everything becomes wearisome, and no one can explain it. The eye is not satisfied by what it sees, nor is the ear fulfilled by what it hears. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,1,"9 Whatever has been is what will be, and whatever has been done is what will be done. There is nothing new under the sun. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,1,"10 Is there anything about which it may be said, 'Look, this is new'? Whatever exists has already existed for a long time, during ages which came long before us. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,1,"11 No one seems to remember the things that happened in ancient times, and the things that happened much later and that will happen in the future will not likely be remembered either.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,1,"12 I am the Teacher, and I have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,1,13 I applied my mind to study and to search out by wisdom everything that is done under heaven. That search is a burdensome task that God has given to the children of mankind to be busy with. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,1,"14 I have seen all the deeds that are done under the sun, and look, they all amount to vapor and chasing the wind. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,1,15 The twisted cannot be straightened! The missing cannot be counted! 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,1,"16 I have spoken to my heart saying, “Look, I have acquired greater wisdom than all who were before me in Jerusalem. My mind has seen great wisdom and knowledge.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,1,17 So I applied my heart to know wisdom and also madness and folly. I came to understand that this also was an attempt to shepherd the wind. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,1,"18 For in the abundance of wisdom there is much frustration, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,"1 I said in my heart, “Come now, I will test you with happiness. So enjoy pleasure.” But look, this also was just a temporary breeze. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,"2 I said about laughter, “It is crazy,” and about pleasure, “What use is it?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,3 I explored in my heart how to gratify my desires with wine. I let my mind guide me with wisdom although I was still holding on to folly. I wanted to find out what is good for people to do under heaven during the days of their lives. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,4 I accomplished great things. I built houses for myself and planted vineyards. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,5 I built for myself gardens and parks; I planted all kinds of fruit trees in them. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,6 I created pools of water to water a forest where trees were grown. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,"7 I purchased male slaves and female slaves; I had slaves born in my palace. I also had large herds and flocks of livestock, much more than any king who ruled before me in Jerusalem. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,"8 I also accumulated for myself silver and gold, the treasures of kings and provinces. I got male and female singers for myself—the delights of the children of humanity—and many concubines. * "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,"9 So I became greater and wealthier than all who were before me in Jerusalem, and my wisdom remained with me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,"10 Whatever my eyes desired, I did not withhold from them. I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure, because my heart rejoiced in all my labor and pleasure was my reward for all my work. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,"11 Then I looked on all the deeds that my hands had accomplished, and on the work that I had done, but again, everything was vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind. There was no profit under the sun in it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,"12 Then I turned to consider wisdom, and also madness and folly. For what can the next king do who comes after the king, which has not already been done? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,"13 Then I began to understand that wisdom has advantages over folly, just as light is better than darkness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,"14 The wise man uses his eyes in his head to see where he is going, but the fool walks in darkness, although I know the same event happens to all of them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,"15 Then I said in my heart, “What happens to the fool, will also happen to me. So what difference does it make if I am very wise?” I concluded in my heart, “This too is only vapor.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,"16 For the wise man, like the fool, is not remembered for very long. In the days to come everything will have been long forgotten. The wise man dies just like the fool dies. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,17 So I detested life because all the work done under the sun was evil to me. This was because everything is vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,18 I hated all my accomplishments for which I had worked under the sun because I must leave them behind to the man who comes after me. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,19 For who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will be master over everything under the sun that * my work and wisdom have built. This also is vapor. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,20 Therefore my heart began to despair over all the work under the sun that I did. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,"21 For there might be someone who works with wisdom, with knowledge, and skill, but he will leave everything he has to a man who has not made any of it. This also is vapor and a great tragedy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,22 For what profit does the person gain who works so hard and tries in his heart to complete his labors under the sun? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,"23 Every day his work is painful and stressful, so at night his soul does not find rest. This also is vapor. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,24 There is nothing better for anyone than to simply eat and drink and be satisfied with what is good in his work. I saw that this truth comes from God's hand. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,25 For who can eat or who can have any kind of pleasure apart from God? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,2,"26 For to anyone who pleases him, God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy. However, to the sinner he gives the work of gathering and storing up so that he may give it away to someone who pleases God. This also amounts to vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind. 3 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,3,"1 For everything there is an appointed time, and a season for every purpose under heaven. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,3,"2 There is a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to pull up plants, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,3,"3 a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build up. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,3,"4 There is a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,3,"5 a time to throw away stones and a time to gather stones, a time to embrace other people, and a time to refrain from embracing. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,3,"6 There is a time to look for things and a time to stop looking, a time to keep things and a time to throw away things, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,3,"7 a time to tear clothing and a time to repair clothing, a time to keep silent and a time to speak. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,3,"8 There is a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,3,9 What profit does the worker gain in his labor? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,3,10 I have seen the work that God has given to human beings to complete. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,3,"11 God has made everything suitable for its own time. He has also placed eternity in their hearts. But mankind cannot understand the deeds that God has done, from their beginning all the way to their end. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,3,12 I know that there is nothing better for anyone than to rejoice and to do good so long as he lives— 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,3,"13 and that everyone should eat and drink, and should understand how to enjoy the good that comes from all his work. This is a gift from God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,3,"14 I know that whatever God does lasts forever. Nothing can be added to it or taken away, because it is God who has done it so that people will approach him with honor. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,3,15 Whatever exists has already existed; whatever will exist has already existed. God makes human beings seek hidden things. * 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,3,"16 I have seen the wickedness that is under the sun, where there should be justice, and in place of righteousness, wickedness was there. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,3,"17 I said in my heart, “God will judge the righteous and the wicked at the right time for every matter and every * deed.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,3,"18 I said in my heart, “God tests human beings to show them that they are like animals.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,3,19 For the fate of the children of mankind and the fate of animals is the same fate for them. The death of one is like the death of the other. The breath is the same for all of them. There is no advantage for mankind over the animals. For is not everything just a breath? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,3,"20 Everything is going to the same place. Everything comes from the dust, and everything returns to the dust. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,3,21 Who knows whether the spirit of mankind goes upward and the spirit of animals goes downward into the earth? † 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,3,"22 So again I realized that there is nothing better for anyone than to take pleasure in his work, for that is his assignment. Who can bring him back to see what happens after him? 4 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,4,"1 Once again I thought about all the oppression that is done under the sun. And behold, the tears of oppressed people, and they had no one to comfort them! Power was in the hand of their oppressors, and there was no one to comfort them! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,4,"2 So I considered those who are already dead more fortunate than the living, who are still alive. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,4,"3 However, more fortunate than both of them is the one who has not yet lived, the one who has not seen any of the evil acts that are done under the sun. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,4,4 Then I saw that every act of labor and every skillful work became the envy of one's neighbor. This also is vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,4,"5 The fool folds his hands and does not work, so his food is his own flesh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,4,6 But better is a handful of profit with quiet work than two handfuls with the work that tries to shepherd the wind. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,4,"7 Then I thought again about more futility, more vanishing vapor under the sun. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,4,"8 There is the kind of man who is alone. He does not have anyone, no son or brother. There is no end to all his work, and his eyes are not satisfied with gaining wealth. He wonders, “For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?” This also is vapor, a bad situation. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,4,9 Two people work better than one; together they can earn a good pay for their labor. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,4,"10 For if one falls, the other can lift up his friend. However, sorrow follows the one who is alone when he falls if there is no one to lift him up. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,4,"11 If two lie down together, they can be warm, but how can one be warm alone? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,4,"12 One man alone can be overpowered, but two can withstand an attack, and a three-strand rope is not quickly broken. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,4,13 It is better to be a poor but wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to listen to warnings. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,4,"14 This is true even if the young man becomes king from prison, or even if he was born poor in his kingdom. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,4,"15 I saw everyone who was alive and was walking around under the sun, along with a youth who † was to rise up to take his place. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,4,"16 There is no end to all the people who want to obey the new king, but later many of them will no longer praise him. Surely this situation is vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind. 5 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,5,"1 Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. Go near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools, who do not understand that they are doing what is wrong. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,5,"2 Do not be too quick to speak with your mouth, and do not let your heart be too quick to bring any matter up before God. God is in heaven, but you are on earth, so let your words be few. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,5,"3 If you have too many things to do and worry about, you will probably have bad dreams. The more words you speak, the more foolish things you will probably say. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,5,"4 When you make a vow to God, do not delay to do it, for God has no pleasure in fools. Do what you vow you will do. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,5,5 It is better not to make a vow than to make one that you do not carry out. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,5,"6 Do not allow your mouth to cause your flesh to sin. Do not say to the priest's messenger, “That vow was a mistake.” Why make God angry by vowing falsely, provoking God to destroy the work of your hands? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,5,"7 For in many dreams, as in many words, there is meaningless vapor. So fear God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,5,"8 When you see the poor being oppressed and robbed of just and right treatment in your province, do not be astonished as if no one knows, because there are people in power who watch those under them, and there are even higher ones over them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,5,"9 In addition, the produce of the land is for everyone, and the king himself takes produce from the fields. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,5,"10 Anyone who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver, and anyone who loves wealth always wants more. This, too, is vapor. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,5,"11 As prosperity increases, so also do the people who consume it. What advantage in wealth is there to the owner except to watch it with his eyes? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,5,"12 The sleep of a working man is sweet, whether he eats little or a lot, but the wealth of a rich person does not allow him to sleep well. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,5,"13 There is an evil that I have seen under the sun riches hoarded by the owner, resulting in his own misery. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,5,"14 When the rich man loses his wealth through bad luck, his own son, one whom he has fathered, is left with nothing in his hands. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,5,"15 As a man comes from his mother's womb, so also he will leave naked. He can take none of the fruits of his labor in his hand. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,5,"16 Another evil is that as a person comes, so he goes away. So what profit is there for him who works for the wind? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,5,17 During his days he eats with darkness and is greatly distressed with sickness and anger. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,5,"18 Look, what I have seen to be good and suitable is to eat and drink and to enjoy the gain from all our work, as we labor under the sun during the days of this life that God has given us. For this is man's assignment. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,5,19 Anyone to whom God has given riches and wealth and the ability to receive his share and rejoice in his work—this is a gift from God. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,5,"20 For he does not call to mind very often the days of his life, because God makes him keep busy with the things thathe enjoys doing."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,6,"1 There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it weighs heavy on men. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,6,"2 God might give riches, wealth, and honor to a man so that he lacks nothing that he desires for himself, but then God gives him no ability to enjoy it. Instead, someone else uses his things. This is vapor, an evil affliction. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,6,"3 If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but if his heart is not satisfied with good and he is not buried, then I say that a baby that is born dead is better off than he is. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,6,"4 Even such a baby is born in futility and passes away in darkness, and its name remains hidden. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,6,"5 Although this child does not see the sun or know anything, it has rest even though that man did not. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,6,"6 Even if a man should live for two thousand years but does not learn to enjoy good things, he goes to the same place as everyone else. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,6,"7 All a man's work is for his mouth, yet his appetite is not satisfied. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,6,"8 Indeed, what advantage has the wise person over the fool? What advantage does the poor man have even if he knows how to act in front of other people? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,6,"9 It is better to be satisfied with what the eyes see than to desire what a wandering appetite craves, which is also vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,6,"10 Whatever has existed has already been given its name, and what mankind is like has already been known. So it has become useless to dispute with the one who is the mighty judge of all. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,6,"11 The more words that are spoken, the more futility increases, so what advantage is that to a man? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,6,"12 For who knows what is good for man in his life during his futile, numbered days through which he passes like a shadow? Who can tell a man what will come under the sun after he passes? 7 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"1 A good name is better than costly perfume, and the day of death is better than the day of birth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"2 It is better to go to a house of mourning than to a house of feasting, for mourning comes to all people at the end of life, so living people must take this to heart. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"3 Grief is better than laughter, for after sadness of face comes gladness of heart. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of feasting. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,5 It is better to listen to the rebuke of the wise than to listen to the song of fools. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"6 For like the crackling of thorns burning under a pot, so also is the laughter of fools. This, too, is vapor. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"7 Extortion certainly makes a wise man foolish, and a bribe corrupts the heart. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,8 Better is the end of a matter than the beginning; and the people patient in spirit are better than the proud in spirit.
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"9 Do not be quick to anger in your spirit, for anger resides in the hearts of fools. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"10 Do not say, “Why were the days of old better than these?” For it is not because of wisdom that you ask this question. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"11 Wisdom, like an inheritance, is good. It benefits those who see the sun. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"12 For wisdom provides protection as money can provide protection, but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom gives life to whoever has it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,13 Consider the deeds of God Who can straighten out anything he has made crooked? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"14 When times are good, live happily in that good, but when times are bad, consider this God has allowed both to exist side by side. For this reason, no one will find out anything that is coming after him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"15 I have seen many things in my meaningless days. There are righteous people who perish in spite of their righteousness, and there are wicked people who live a long life in spite of their evil. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"16 Do not be self-righteous, wise in your own eyes. Why should you destroy yourself? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,17 Do not be too wicked or foolish. Why should you die before your time? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"18 It is good that you should take hold of this wisdom, and that you should not let go of righteousness. For the person who fears God will meet all his obligations. * "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"19 Wisdom is powerful in the wise man, more than ten rulers in a city. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,20 There is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"21 Do not listen to every word that is spoken, because you might hear your servant curse you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"22 Similarly, you know yourself that in your own heart you have often cursed others. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"23 All this have I proven by wisdom. I said, “I will be wise,” but it was more than I could be. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,24 Wisdom is far off and very deep. Who can find it? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"25 I turned my heart to learn and examine and seek wisdom and the explanations of reality, and to understand that evil is stupid and that folly is madness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"26 I found that more bitter than death is any woman whose heart is full of snares and nets, and whose hands are chains. Whoever pleases God will escape from her, but the sinner will be taken by her. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"27 “Consider what I have discovered,” says the Teacher. “I have been adding one discovery to another in order to find an explanation of reality. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"28 This is what I am still looking for, but I have not found it. I did find one righteous man among a thousand, but a woman among all those I did not find. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,7,"29 I have discovered only this That * God created humanity upright, but they have gone away looking for manydifficulties.”"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,8,"1 Who is a wise man? Who knows what the events in life mean? Wisdom in a man causes his face to shine, and the hardness of his face is changed. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,8,2 I advise you to obey the king's command because of God's oath to protect him. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,8,"3 Do not hurry out of his presence, and do not stand in support of something wrong, for the king does whatever he desires. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,8,"4 The king's word rules, so who will say to him, “What are you doing?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,8,5 Whoever keeps the king's commands avoids harm. A wise man's heart recognizes the proper course and time of action. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,8,"6 For every matter there is a correct response and a time to respond, because the troubles of man are great. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,8,7 No one knows what is coming next. Who can tell him what is coming? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,8,"8 No one is ruler over his breath so as to stop the breath, * and no one has power over the day of his death. No one is discharged from the army during a battle, and wickedness will not rescue those who are its slaves. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,8,9 I have realized all this; I have applied my heart to every kind of work that is done under the sun. There is a time when a person oppresses another person to that person's hurt. † 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,8,10 So I saw the wicked buried publicly. They were taken from the holy area and buried and were praised by people in the city where they had done their wicked deeds. This also is uselessness. ‡ 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,8,"11 When a sentence against an evil crime is not executed quickly, it entices the hearts of human beings to do evil. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,8,"12 Even though a sinner does evil a hundred times and still lives a long time, yet I know that it will be better for those who respect God, for those who stand before him and show him respect. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,8,13 But it will not go well for a wicked man; his life will not be prolonged. His days are like a fleeting shadow because he does not honor God. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,8,"14 There is another useless vapor—something else that is done on the earth. Things happen to righteous people as they happen to wicked people, and things happen to wicked people as they happen to righteous people. I say that this also is useless vapor. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,8,"15 So I recommend happiness, because a man has no better thing under the sun than to eat and drink and to be happy. It is happiness that will accompany him in his labor for all the days of his life that God has given him under the sun. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,8,"16 When I applied my heart to know wisdom and to understand the work that is done on the earth, work often done without sleep for the eyes at night or in the day, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,8,"17 then I considered all of God's deeds, and that man cannot understand the work that is done under the sun. No matter how much a man labors to find the answers, he will not find them. Even though a wise man might believe he knows, he really does not. *"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,9,1 For I thought about all this in my mind to understand about the righteous and wise people and their deeds. They are all in God's hands. No one knows whether love or hate will come to someone. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,9,"2 Everyone has the same fate. The same fate awaits righteous people and wicked, the good, * the clean and the unclean, and the one who sacrifices and the one who does not sacrifice. As good people will die, so also will the sinner. As the one who swears will die, so also will the man who fears to make an oath. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,9,"3 There is an evil fate for everything that is done under the sun, the same event happens to them all. The hearts of human beings are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live. So after that they go to the dead. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,9,"4 For anyone who is united to all the living, there is hope, just as a living dog is better than a dead lion. † "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,9,"5 For living people know they will die, but the dead do not know anything. They no longer have any reward because their memory is forgotten. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,9,"6 Their love, hatred, and envy have vanished long ago. They will never have a place again in anything done under the sun. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,9,"7 Go your way, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a happy heart, for God approves of celebrating good works. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,9,8 Let your clothes be always white and your head anointed with oil. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,9,"9 Live happily with the wife whom you love all the days of your life of uselessness, the days that God has given you under the sun during your days of uselessness. That is your reward in life for your work under the sun. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,9,"10 Whatever your hand finds to do, work at it with your strength, because there is no work or explanation or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, where you are going. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,9,"11 I have seen some interesting things under the sun The race does not belong to swift people. The battle does not belong to strong people. Bread does not belong to wise people. Riches do not belong to people of understanding. Favor does not belong to people of knowledge. Instead, time and chance affect them all. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,9,"12 Surely, no one knows when his time will come. As fish are caught in a deadly net, or birds are caught in a snare, the children of human beings are ensnared by evil times that suddenly fall upon them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,9,13 I have also seen wisdom under the sun in a way that seemed great to me. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,9,"14 There was a small city with only a few men in it, and a great king came against it and besieged it and built great * siege ramps against it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,9,"15 Now in the city was found a poor, wise man, who by his wisdom saved the city. Yet later, no one remembered that same poor man. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,9,"16 So I concluded, “Wisdom is better than strength, but the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,9,17 The words of wise people spoken quietly are heard better than the shouts of any ruler among fools. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,9,"18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner can ruin much good. 10 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,10,"1 As dead flies cause perfume to stink, so a little folly can overpower wisdom and honor. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,10,"2 The heart of a wise person tends to the right, but the heart of a fool tends to the left. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,10,"3 When a fool walks down a road, his thinking is deficient, proving to everyone he is a fool. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,10,"4 If the emotions of a ruler rise up against you, do not leave your work. Calm can quiet down great outrage. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,10,"5 There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, a kind of error that comes from a ruler "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,10,"6 Fools are given leadership positions, while successful men are given low positions. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,10,"7 I have seen slaves riding horses, and successful men walking like slaves on the ground. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,10,"8 Anyone who digs a pit can fall into it, and whenever someone breaks down a wall, a snake can bite him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,10,"9 Whoever cuts out stones can be hurt by them, and the man who chops wood is endangered by it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,10,"10 If an iron blade is dull, and a man does not sharpen it, then he must use more strength, but wisdom provides an advantage for success. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Ecclesiastes,10,"11 If a snake bites before it is charmed, then there is no advantage for the charmer. "

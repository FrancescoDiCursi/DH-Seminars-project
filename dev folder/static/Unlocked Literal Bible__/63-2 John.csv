Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 John,1,"4 I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, just as we have received this commandment from the Father. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 John,1,"5 Now I plead with you, lady—not as though I were writing to you a new commandment, but one that we have had from the beginning—that we should love one another. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 John,1,"6 This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, just as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 John,1,"7 For many deceivers have gone out into the world, and they do not confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy, First Timothy,
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,1,"1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior and Christ Jesus our hope, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,1,"2 to Timothy, a true son in the faith Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,1,"3 As I urged you to do when I was leaving for Macedonia, remain in Ephesus so that you can command certain people not to teach a different doctrine. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,1,"4 Neither should they pay attention to stories and endless genealogies. These cause arguments rather than helping the plan of God, which is by faith. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,1,"5 Now the goal of the commandment is love from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from a sincere faith. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,1,6 Some people have missed the mark and have turned away from these things to foolish talk. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,1,"7 They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not understand what they are saying or what they so confidently affirm. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,1,8 But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,1,"9 We know this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for a lawless and rebellious people, for ungodly people and sinners, and for those who are godless and profane. It is made for those who kill their fathers and mothers, for murderers, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,1,"10 for sexually immoral people, for homosexuals, for those who kidnap people for slaves, for liars, for false witnesses, and for whatever else is against faithful instruction. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,1,11 This instruction is according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,1,"12 I thank Christ Jesus our Lord. He strengthened me, for he considered me faithful, and he placed me into service. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,1,"13 I was a blasphemer, a persecutor, and a violent man. But I received mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,1,14 But the grace of our Lord overflowed with faith and love that is in Christ Jesus. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,1,"15 This message is reliable and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. I am the worst of these. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,1,"16 But for this reason I was given mercy, so that in me, the foremost, Christ Jesus might demonstrate all patience. He did this as an example for those who would trust in him for eternal life. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,1,"17 Now to the king of the ages, the immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,1,"18 I am placing this command before you, Timothy, my child, in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you, that you might fight the good fight, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,1,"19 holding faith and a good conscience. By rejecting this, some have shipwrecked their faith. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,1,"20 Such are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I gave over to Satan so that they may be taught not to blaspheme. 2 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,2,"1 Therefore first of all, I urge that requests, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,2,"2 for kings and all who are in authority, in order that we may live a peaceful and quiet life in all godliness and dignity. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,2,3 This is good and acceptable before God our savior. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,2,4 He desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,2,"5 For there is one God, and there is one mediator for God and man, the man Christ Jesus. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,2,"6 He gave himself as a ransom for all, as the testimony at the right time. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,2,"7 For this purpose, I myself, was made a herald and an apostle. I am telling the truth. I am not lying. I am a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,2,"8 Therefore, I want men in every place to pray and to lift up holy hands without anger or arguing. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,2,"9 Likewise, I want the women to dress themselves in proper clothing, with modesty and self-control. They should not have braidedhair, or gold, or pearls, or expensive clothing. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,2,10 I want them to dress with what is appropriate for women who profess godliness through good works. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,2,11 A woman should learn in silence and with all submission. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,2,"12 I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man, but to live in quietness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,2,"13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,2,"14 Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,2,"15 However, she will be saved through bearing children, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with soundness of mind. 3 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,3,"1 This saying is trustworthy If someone desires to be an overseer, he desires a good work. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,3,"2 Therefore the overseer must be without reproach. He must be a husband of one wife. He must be moderate, sensible, orderly, and hospitable. He must be able to teach. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,3,"3 He must not be addicted to wine, not a brawler, but instead, gentle, peaceful. He must not be a lover of money. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,3,"4 He should manage his own household well, and his children should obey him with all respect. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,3,"5 For if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for a church of God? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,3,"6 He should not be a new convert, so that he does not swell with pride and might fall into condemnation as the devil. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,3,"7 He must also have a good reputation with those outside, so that he does not fall into disgrace and the trap of the devil. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,3,"8 Deacons, likewise, should be dignified, not double-talkers. They should not drink too much wine or be greedy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,3,9 They should keep the revealed truth of the faith with a clean conscience. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,3,"10 They should also be approved first, then they should serve because they are blameless. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,3,11 Women in the same way should be dignified. They should not be slanderers. They should be moderate and faithful in all things. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,3,12 Deacons must be husbands of one wife. They must manage well their children and household. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,3,13 For those who have served well acquire for themselves a good standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,3,"14 I am writing these things to you, and I expect to come to you soon. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,3,"15 But if I delay, I am writing so that you may know how to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,3,"16 It is undeniable that the revealed truth of godliness is great “He appeared in the flesh, was justified by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was proclaimed among nations, was believed on in the world, and was taken up in glory.” 4 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,4,1 Now the Spirit clearly says that in later times some people will leave the faith and pay attention to deceitful spirits and the teachings of demons 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,4,2 in lying hypocrisy. Their own consciences will be branded. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,4,3 They will forbid to marry and to receive foods that God created for sharing with thanksgiving among those who believe and who know the truth. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,4,4 For everything created by God is good. Nothing that we take with thanksgiving is to be rejected. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,4,5 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,4,"6 If you place these things before the brothers, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ. For you are being nourished by the words of faith and by the good teaching that you have followed. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,4,"7 But reject worldly stories loved by old women. Instead, train yourself in godliness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,4,"8 For bodily training is a little useful, but godliness is useful for all things. It holds promise for this life now and the life to come. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,4,9 This message is trustworthy and worthy of full acceptance. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,4,"10 For it is for this that we struggle and work very hard. For we have hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, but especially of believers. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,4,11 Proclaim and teach these things. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,4,"12 Let no one despise your youth. Instead, be an example for those who believe, in speech, conduct, love, faithfulness, and purity. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,4,"13 Until I come, attend to the reading, to the exhortation, and to the teaching. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,4,"14 Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the elders. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,4,"15 Care for these things. Be in them, so that your progress may be evident to all people. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,4,"16 Give careful attention to yourself and to the teaching. Continue in these things. For by doing so, you will save yourself and those who listen to you. 5 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,"1 Do not scold an older man. Instead, exhort him as if he were a father. Exhort younger men as if they were brothers. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,"2 Exhort older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters in all purity. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,"3 Honor widows, the real widows. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,"4 But if a widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show honor in their own household. Let them repay their parents, because this is pleasing to God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,5 But a real widow is left all alone. She puts her certain hope in God. She always remains with requests and prayers both night and day. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,"6 However, the woman who lives for pleasure is dead, even though she is still alive. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,"7 Give these instructions as well, so that they may be blameless. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,"8 But if someone does not provide for his own relatives, especially for those of his own household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,"9 Let a woman be enrolled as a widow who is not younger than sixty, a wife of one husband. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,"10 She must be known for good deeds, whether it is that she has cared for children, or has been hospitable to strangers, or has washed the feet of the saints, or has relieved the afflicted, or has been devoted to every good work. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,"11 But as for younger widows, refuse to enroll them in the list. For when they give in to bodily desires against Christ, they want to marry. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,12 In this way they incur guilt because they revoke their first commitment. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,"13 At the same time, they also learn to be lazy and they go around from house to house. They not only become lazy, but they also talk nonsense and are busybodies, saying things they should not say. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,"14 I therefore want younger women to marry, to bear children, to manage the household, and to give no opportunity for the enemy to slander us. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,15 For some have already turned aside after Satan. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,"16 If any believing woman has widows, let her help them, so that the church will not be weighed down, so that it might help the real widows. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,"17 Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work with the word and in teaching. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,"18 For the scripture says, “You shall not put a muzzle on an ox while it treads the grain” and “The laborer is worthy of his wages.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,19 Do not receive an accusation against an elder unless there are two or three witnesses. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,20 Correct sinners before all so that the rest may be afraid. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,"21 I solemnly command you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels, to keep these commands without partiality, and to do nothing out of favoritism. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,22 Place hands hastily on no one. Do not share in the sins of another person. You should keep yourself pure. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,"23 You should no longer drink water. Instead, you should take a little wine for the stomach and your frequent sicknesses. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,"24 The sins of some people are openly known, and they go before them into judgment. But some sins follow later. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,5,"25 Likewise, some good works are openly known, but even the others cannot be hidden. 6 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,6,1 Let all who are under the yoke as slaves regard their own masters as worthy of all honor. They should do this so that the name of God and the teaching might not be blasphemed. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,6,"2 The slaves who have believing masters should not disrespect them because they are brothers. Instead, they should serve them all the more. For the masters who are helped by their work are believers and are loved. Teach and declare these things. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,6,"3 If anyone teaches something that does not agree with the reliable instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,6,"4 he is proud and understands nothing. He has an unhealthy interest in controversies and arguments about words that result in envy, strife, insults, evil suspicions, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,6,5 and constant conflict between people with depraved minds. They have lost the truth and they think that godliness is a way to get more money. * 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,6,6 Now godliness with contentment is great gain. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,6,7 For we have brought nothing into the world. Neither are we able to take out anything. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,6,"8 Instead, let us be satisfied with food and clothing. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,6,"9 Now those who want to become wealthy fall into temptation, into a trap. They fall into many foolish and harmful passions, and into whatever else makes people sink into ruin and destruction. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,6,10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people who desire it have been mislead away from the faith and have pierced themselves with much grief. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,6,"11 But you, man of God, flee from these things. Pursue righteousness, godliness, faithfulness, love, endurance, and gentleness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,6,"12 Fight the good fight of faith. Take hold of the everlasting life to which you were called, and about which you gave the good confession before many witnesses. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,6,"13 I give you this command before God, who causes all things to live, and before Christ Jesus, who spoke what is true to Pontius Pilate "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,6,14 Keep the commandment without spot or blame until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,6,"15 God will reveal Christ's appearing at the right time—God, the blessed and only Sovereign, the King who reigns and the Lord who rules. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,6,16 Only he has immortality and dwells in inapproachable light. No man sees him or is able to view him. To him be honor and eternal power. Amen. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,6,"17 Tell the rich in this world not to be proud, and not to hope in riches, which are uncertain. Instead, they should hope in God. He offers to us all the true riches to enjoy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,6,"18 Tell them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, and willing to share. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,6,"19 In that way, they will store up for themselves a good foundation for what is to come, so that they will take hold of real life. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,6,"20 Timothy, protect what was given to you. Avoid the foolish talk and conflicting ideas of what is falsely called knowledge. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Timothy,6,21 Some men proclaim these things and so they have missed the faith. May grace be with you. *

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,50,"16 But to the wicked God says, “What have you to do with declaring my statutes, that you have taken my covenant in your mouth, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,50,17 since you hate instruction and throw my words away? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,50,"18 When you see a thief, you agree with him; you participate with those who commit adultery. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,50,"19 You give your mouth to evil, and your tongue expresses deceit. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,50,20 You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother's son.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,51,"6 See, you desire trustworthiness in my inner self; and you teach me wisdom in the secret place within."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,51,"7 Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,51,"15 Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will express your praise. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,51,"16 For you do not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it; you have no pleasure in burnt offerings. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,52,"1 Why are you proud of making trouble, you mighty man? The covenant faithfulness of God comes every day. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,52,"2 Your tongue plans destruction like a sharp razor, working deceitfully. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,52,3 You love evil more than good and lying rather than speaking righteousness. Selah 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,52,"4 You love all words that devour others, you deceitful tongue. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,52,5 God will likewise destroy you forever; he will take you up and pluck you out of your tent and root you out of the land of the living. Selah

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,5 For he established covenant decrees in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel. He commanded our ancestors that they were to teach them to their children.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,"21 When Yahweh heard this, he was angry; so his fire burned against Jacob, and his anger attacked Israel, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,22 because they did not believe in God and did not trust in his salvation.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,30 But they had not yet filled up; their food was still in their mouths. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,31 Then God's anger attacked them and killed the strongest of them. He brought down the young men of Israel. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,"32 Despite this, they continued to sin and did not believe his wonderful deeds."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,33 Therefore God cut short their days; their years were filled with terror. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,"34 Whenever God afflicted them, they would start to seek him, and they would return and look earnestly for him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,35 They would call to mind that God was their rock and that the Most High God was their rescuer. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,36 But they would flatter him with their mouth and lie to him with their words. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,"37 For their hearts were not firmly fixed on him, and they were not faithful to his covenant. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,"38 Yet he, being merciful, forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them. Yes, many times he held back his anger and did not stir up all his wrath. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,"42 They did not think about his power, how he had rescued them from the enemy "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,43 when he performed his terrifying signs in Egypt and his wonders in the region of Zoan. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,44 He turned the Egyptians' rivers to blood so that they could not drink from their streams. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,45 He sent swarms of flies that devoured them and frogs that overran their land. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,46 He gave their crops to the grasshopper and their labor to the locust. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,47 He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore trees with more hail. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,48 He rained hail on their cattle and hurled lightning bolts at their livestock. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,"49 The fierceness of his anger lashed out against them. He sent wrath, fury, and trouble like agents who bring disaster. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,50 He leveled a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but gave them over to the plague. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,"51 He killed all the firstborn in Egypt, the firstborn of their strength in the tents of Ham. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,52 He led his own people out like sheep and guided them through the wilderness like a flock. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,"53 He led them secure and unafraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,"54 Then he brought them to the border of his holy land, to this mountain that his right hand acquired. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,55 He drove out the nations from before them and assigned them their inheritance. He settled the tribes of Israel in their tents. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,56 Yet they challenged and defied the Most High God and did not keep his solemn commands.
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,57 They were unfaithful and acted treacherously like their fathers; they were as undependable as a faulty bow. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,58 For they made him angry with their high places and provoked him to jealous anger with their idols. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,"59 When God heard this, he was angry and completely rejected Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,"60 He abandoned the sanctuary of Shiloh, the tent where he had lived among people. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,61 He allowed his strength to be captured and gave his glory into the enemy's hand. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,"62 He handed his people over to the sword, and he was angry with his heritage. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,"63 Fire devoured their young men, and their young women had no wedding songs. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,"64 Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows could not weep. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,"65 Then the Lord awakened as one from sleep, like a warrior who shouts because of wine. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,66 He drove his adversaries back; he put them to everlasting shame. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,"67 He rejected the tent of Joseph, and he did not chose the tribe of Ephraim. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,68 He chose the tribe of Judah and Mount Zion that he loved. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,"69 He built his sanctuary like the heavens, like the earth that he has established forever. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,78,"70 He chose David, his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,79,"3 They have shed their blood like water around Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,79,"4 We have become a reproach for our neighbors, mocking and derision to those who are around us. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,102,13 You will rise up and have mercy on Zion. Now is the time to have mercy upon her; the appointed time has come.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,103,9 He will not always discipline; he is not always angry. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,103,10 He does not deal with us as our sins deserve or repay us for what our sins demand.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,103,"13 As a father has compassion on his children, so Yahweh has compassion on those who honor him. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,104,6 You covered the earth with water like a garment; the water covered the mountains.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,104,9 You have set a boundary for them that they will not cross; they will not cover the earth again.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,104,17 There the birds make their nests. The stork makes the cypress tree her home. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,104,18 The wild goats live on the high mountains; the mountain heights are a refuge for the hyraxes. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,104,19 He appointed the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows its time for setting. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,104,20 You make the darkness of the night when all the beasts of the forest come out.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,105,"12 He said this when they were only few in number, so very few, and were strangers in the land. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,105,13 They went from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,105,14 He did not allow anyone to oppress them; he rebuked kings for their sakes. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,105,"15 He said, “Do not touch my anointed ones, and do not harm my prophets.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,105,16 He called for a famine on the land; he cut off the whole supply of bread. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,105,17 He sent a man ahead of them; Joseph was sold as a servant. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,105,"18 His feet were bound by shackles; on his neck was put an iron collar, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,105,19 until what he had said came to pass. The word of Yahweh tested him.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"9 He rebuked the Sea of Reeds, and it dried up. Then he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"10 He saved them from the hand of those who hated them, and he rescued them from the hand of the enemy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,11 But the waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"12 Then they believed his words, and they sang his praise. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,13 But they quickly forgot what he had done; they did not wait for his instructions. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"14 They had insatiable cravings in the wilderness, and they challenged God in the desert. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"15 So he gave them what they requested, but he sent a horrible disease upon them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"16 In the camp they became jealous of Moses and Aaron, the holy priest of Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the followers of Abiram. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,18 Fire broke out among them; the fire consumed the wicked. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,19 They made a calf at Horeb and worshiped a cast metal figure. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,20 They traded the glory of God for the image of a bull that eats grass. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"21 They forgot God their Savior, who had done great deeds in Egypt. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,22 He had done wonderful things in the land of Ham and mighty acts at the Sea of Reeds. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"23 So he said he would destroy them— had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him, to turn away his anger from destroying them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"24 Then they despised the fruitful land; they did not believe his promise, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"25 but grumbled in their tents, and did not obey Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"26 Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them that he would let them die in the desert, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"27 scatter their descendants among the nations, and scatter them in foreign lands. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,28 They worshiped the Baal of Peor and ate the sacrifices offered to the dead. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"29 They provoked him to anger with their actions, and a plague broke out among them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"30 Then Phinehas rose to intervene, and the plague subsided. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,31 It was counted to him as a righteous deed to all generations forever. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"32 They also angered Yahweh at the waters of Meribah, and Moses suffered because of them."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"33 They made Moses bitter, and he spoke rashly. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"34 They did not destroy the nations as Yahweh had commanded them, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,35 but they mingled with the nations and learned their ways 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"36 and worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,37 They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"38 They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, desecrating the land with blood. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,39 They were defiled by their deeds; in their actions they were like prostitutes. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"40 So Yahweh was angry with his people, and he despised his own people. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"41 He gave them into the hand of the nations, and those who hated them ruled over them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"42 Their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection to their authority. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"43 Many times he came to help them, but they kept rebelling and were brought low by their own sin. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"44 Nevertheless, he paid attention to their distress when he heard their cry for help. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,45 He called to mind his covenant with them and relented because of his steadfast love. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,46 He caused all their conquerers to have pity on them. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,106,"47 Save us, Yahweh, our God. Gather us from among the nations so that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praises. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,"5 Because they were hungry and thirsty, they fainted from exhaustion."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,"6 Then they called out to Yahweh in their trouble, and he rescued them out of their distress. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,"10 Some sat in darkness and in gloom, prisoners in affliction and chains. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,11 This was because they had rebelled against God's word and rejected the instruction of the Most High. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,12 He humbled their hearts through hardship; they stumbled and there was no one to help them up. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,"13 Then they called out to Yahweh in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distress. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,14 He brought them out of darkness and gloom and broke their bonds.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,24 These saw the deeds of Yahweh and his wonders on the seas. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,25 For he commanded and aroused the windstorm that stirs up the seas. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,26 They reached up to the sky; they went down to the depths. Their lives melted away in distress. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,27 They swayed and staggered like drunkards and were at their wits' end. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,"28 Then they called out to Yahweh in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distress. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,"29 He calmed the storm, and the waves were stilled. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,"30 Then they rejoiced because the sea was calm, and he brought them to their desired harbor. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,32 Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people and praise him in the council of the elders. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,"33 He turns rivers into a wilderness, springs of water into dry land, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,34 and a fruitful land into a barren place because of the wickedness of its people. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,35 He turns the wilderness into a pool of water and dry land into springs of water. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,"36 He settles the hungry there, and they build a city to live in. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,"37 They build a city to plant fields in, to plant vineyards, and to bring in an abundant harvest. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,38 He blesses them so they are very numerous. He does not let their cattle decrease in number. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,39 They were diminished and brought low by painful distress and suffering. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,"40 He pours contempt on the leaders and causes them to wander in the wilderness, where there are no roads. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Psalms,107,41 But he protects the needy from affliction and cares for his families like a flock.

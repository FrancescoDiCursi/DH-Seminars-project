Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel, Second Samuel,
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"1 After the death of Saul, David returned from attacking the Amalekites and remained in Ziklag for two days. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"2 On the third day, a man came from Saul's camp with his clothes torn and with dirt on his head. When he came to David he lay facedown on the ground and prostrated himself. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"3 David said to him, “Where did you come from?” He answered, “I escaped from the camp of Israel.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"4 David said to him, “Please tell me how things went.” He answered, “The people fled from the battle. Many have fallen and many are dead. Saul and Jonathan his son are also dead.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"5 David said to the young man, “How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"6 The young man replied, “By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there Saul was leaning on his spear, and chariots and riders were about to catch up with him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"7 Saul turned around and saw me and called out to me. I answered, 'Here I am.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"8 He said to me, 'Who are you?' I answered him, 'I am an Amalekite.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"9 He said to me, 'Please stand over me and kill me, for great suffering has taken hold of me, but life is still in me.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"10 So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew that he would not live after he had fallen. Then I took the crown that was on his head and the band that was on his arm, and brought them here to you, my master.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"11 Then David tore his clothes, and all the men with him did the same. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"12 They mourned, wept, and fasted until evening for Saul, for Jonathan his son, for the people of Yahweh, and for the house of Israel because they had fallen by the sword. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"13 David said to the young man, “Where are you from?” He answered, “I am the son of a foreigner in the land, an Amalekite.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"14 David said to him, “Why were you not afraid to kill Yahweh's anointed king with your own hand?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"15 David called one of the young men and said, “Go and kill him.” So that man went and struck him down, and the Amalekite died. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"16 Then David said to the dead Amalekite, “Your blood is on your head because your own mouth has testified against you and said, 'I have killed Yahweh's anointed king.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,17 Then David sung this funeral song about Saul and Jonathan his son. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"18 He commanded the people to teach this Song of the Bow to the sons of Judah, which has been written in the Book of Jashar. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"19 “Your glory, Israel, is dead, killed on your high places! How the mighty have fallen! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"20 Do not tell it in Gath, do not proclaim it in the streets of Ashkelon, so that the daughters of the Philistines may not rejoice, so that the daughters of the uncircumcised may not celebrate. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"21 Mountains of Gilboa, let there not be dew or rain on you, nor fields giving grain for offerings, for there the shield of the mighty was defiled. The shield of Saul is no longer anointed with oil. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"22 From the blood of those who have been killed, from the bodies of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, and the sword of Saul did not return empty."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"23 Saul and Jonathan were loved and gracious in life, and in their death they were not separated. They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"24 You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet as well as jewels, and who put ornaments of gold on your clothing. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,25 How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is killed on your high places. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"26 I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan. You were very dear to me. Your love to me was wonderful, exceeding the love of women. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,1,"27 How the mighty have fallen, and the weapons of war perished!” 2 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"1 After this David asked Yahweh and said, “Should I go up to one of the cities of Judah?” Yahweh replied to him, “Go up.” David said, “To which city should I go?” Yahweh replied, “To Hebron.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"2 So David went up with his two wives, Ahinoam from Jezreel, and Abigail from Carmel, the widow of Nabal. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"3 David brought the men who were with him, who each brought his family, to the cities of Hebron, where they began to live. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"4 Then men from Judah came and anointed David king over the house of Judah. They told David, “The men of Jabesh Gilead have buried Saul.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"5 So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead and said to them, “You are blessed by Yahweh, since you have showed this loyalty to your master Saul and have buried him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,6 Now may Yahweh show you covenantal loyalty and faithfulness. I also will show you this goodness because you have done this thing. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"7 Now then, let your hands be strong; be courageous for Saul your master is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"8 But Abner son of Ner, commander of Saul's army, took Ishbosheth son of Saul and brought him to Mahanaim. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"9 He made Ishbosheth king over Gilead, Asher, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, and over all Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"10 Ishbosheth son of Saul, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,11 The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"12 Abner son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"13 Joab son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon. There they sat down, one group on one side of the pool and the other on the other side. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"14 Abner said to Joab, “Let the young men arise and compete before us.” Then Joab said, “Let them arise.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"15 Then the young men got up and gathered together, twelve for Benjamin and Ishbosheth son of Saul, and twelve from servants of David. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"16 Each man seized his opponent by the head and thrust his sword into the side of his opponent, and they fell down together. Therefore that place was called “Helkath Hazzurim,” or “Field of Swords,” which is in Gibeon. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,17 The battle was very severe that day and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated before the servants of David. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"18 The three sons of Zeruiah were there Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel was swift in his feet like a wild gazelle. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,19 Asahel closely pursued Abner and followed him without turning away in any direction. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"20 Abner looked behind him and said, “Is that you Asahel?” He answered, “It is I.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"21 Abner said to him, “Turn aside to your right or to your left, and seize one of the young men and take his armor.” But Asahel would not turn aside. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"22 So Abner said again to Asahel, “Stop pursuing me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I hold up my face to Joab, your brother?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"23 But Asahel refused to turn aside, and so Abner stabbed him in the body with the blunt end of his spear, so that the spear came out the other side. Asahel fell down and died there. So it came about that anyone who arrived at the place where Asahel fell down and died, he stopped and stood still. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"24 But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. When the sun was going down, they came to the hill of Ammah, which is near Giah by the road to the wilderness of Gibeon. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,25 The men of Benjamin gathered themselves together behind Abner and stood on the top of the hill. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"26 Then Abner called to Joab and said, “Must the sword devour forever? Do you not know it will be bitter in the end? How long will it be before you tell your men to stop pursuing their brothers?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"27 Joab replied, “Just as God lives, if you had not said that, my soldiers would have pursued their brothers until the morning!” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"28 So Joab blew the trumpet, and all his men stopped and did not pursue Israel anymore, nor did they fight anymore. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"29 Abner and his men traveled all that night through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, marched all the next morning, and then reached Mahanaim. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"30 Joab returned from pursuing Abner. He assembled all his men, from whom were missing Asahel and nineteen of David's soldiers. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,31 But the men of David had killed  360 men of Benjamin with Abner. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,2,"32 Then they took up Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Bethlehem. Joab and his men traveled all night, and the day dawned on them at Hebron. 3 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"1 Now there was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. David grew stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"2 Sons were born to David in Hebron. His firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam from Jezreel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"3 His second son, Kileab, was born to Abigail, the widow of Nabal from Carmel. The third, Absalom, was son of Maacah, daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"4 David's fourth son, Adonijah, was the son of Haggith. His fifth son was Shephatiah son of Abital, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"5 and the sixth, Ithream, was the son of David's wife Eglah. These sons were born to David in Hebron. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,6 It came about during the war between the house of Saul and the house of David that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"7 Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. Ishbosheth said to Abner, “Why have you slept with my father's concubine?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"8 Then Abner was very angry at the words of Ishbosheth and said, “Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah? Today I am showing faithfulness to the house of Saul, your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, by not delivering you into the hand of David. But now you accuse me of an offense concerning this woman? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"9 May God do so to me, Abner, and more also, if I do not do for David as Yahweh has sworn to him, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"10 to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beersheba.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"11 Ishbosheth could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"12 Then Abner sent messengers to David to speak for him saying, “Whose land is this? Make a covenant with me, and you will see that my hand is with you, to bring all Israel to you.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"13 David answered, “Good, I will make a covenant with you. But one thing I require from you is that you cannot see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see me.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"14 Then David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul's son, saying, “Give me my wife Michal, for whom I paid a price of one hundred Philistine foreskins.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"15 So Ishbosheth sent for Michal and took her from her husband, Paltiel son of Laish. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"16 Her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Return home now.” So he returned. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"17 Abner spoke with the elders of Israel saying, “In the past you were trying to have David be king over you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"18 Now do it. For Yahweh has spoken of David saying, 'By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,19 Abner also spoke personally to the people of Benjamin. Then Abner went also to speak with David in Hebron to explain everything that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin desired to accomplish. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"20 When Abner and twenty of his men arrived in Hebron to see David, David had a feast prepared for them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"21 Abner explained to David, “I will arise and gather all Israel to you, my master the king, so that they may make a covenant with you, so that you may reign over all that you desire.” So David sent Abner away, and Abner left in peace. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"22 Then the soldiers of David and Joab came from a raid and brought much plunder with them. But Abner was not with David in Hebron. David had sent him away, and Abner had left in peace. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"23 When Joab and all the army with him arrived, they told Joab, “Abner son of Ner came to the king, and the king has sent him away, and Abner left in peace.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"24 Then Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Look, Abner came to you! Why have you sent him away, and he is gone? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,25 Do you not know that Abner son of Ner came to deceive you and to discover your plans and learn everything you are doing?” 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"26 When Joab left David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah, but David did not know this. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"27 When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the middle of the gate to speak with him quietly. There Joab stabbed him in the stomach and killed him. In this way, Joab avenged the blood of Asahel his brother. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"28 When David heard about this he said, “I and my kingdom are innocent before Yahweh forever regarding the blood of Abner son of Ner. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,29 Let the guilt of Abner's death fall on the head of Joab and on all his father's house. May there never fail to be in the family of Joab someone who has a flowing sore or skin disease or who is lame and must walk with a staff or who is killed by the sword or who goes without food.” 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"30 So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in battle. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"31 David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner's body.” Now King David walked behind the body in the funeral procession. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"32 They buried Abner in Hebron. The king wept and cried loudly at the tomb of Abner, and all the people also wept. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"33 The king lamented for Abner and sang, “Should Abner die as a fool dies? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"34 Your hands were not bound. Your feet were not shackled. As a man falls before the sons of injustice, so you have fallen.” Once more all the people wept over him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"35 All the people came to make David eat while it was still day, but David swore, “May God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun goes down.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"36 All the people took notice of David's grief, and it pleased them, as whatever the king did pleased them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,37 So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not the king's desire to kill Abner son of Ner. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"38 The king said to his servants, “Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,3,"39 Now I am weak today, though I am an anointed king. These men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too brutal for me. May Yahweh repay the evildoer by punishing him for his wickedness, as he deserves.” 4 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,4,"1 When Ishbosheth, Saul's son, heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became weak, and all Israel was troubled. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,4,"2 Now Saul's son had two men who were captains of groups of soldiers. The name of one was Baanah and the other Recab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite of the people of Benjamin (for Beeroth is also considered part of Benjamin, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,4,3 and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have been living there until this very time). 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,4,"4 Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son who was crippled in his feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up to flee. But as she was running, Jonathan's son fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,4,"5 So the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Recab and Baanah, traveled during the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, as he was resting at noon. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,4,"6 The woman guarding the door had fallen asleep while sifting wheat, and Recab and Baanah walked in quietly and passed her. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,4,"7 So after they entered the house, they attacked him and killed him as he was lying on his bed in his room. Then they cut off his head and carried it away, traveling on the road all night to the Arabah. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,4,"8 They brought the head of Ishbosheth to David at Hebron, and they said to the king, “Look, this is the head of Ishbosheth son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life. Today Yahweh has avenged our master the king against Saul and his descendants.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,4,"9 David answered Recab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite; he said to them, “As Yahweh lives, who delivered my life from every trouble, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,4,"10 when someone told me, 'Look, Saul is dead,' thinking he was bringing good news, I seized him and killed him at Ziklag. That was the reward I gave him for his news. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,4,"11 How much more, when wicked men have killed an innocent person in his own house on his bed, should I not now require his blood from your hand, and remove you from the earth?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,4,"12 Then David gave orders to the young men, and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet and hung them up beside the pool at Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron. 5 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,"1 Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, “Look, we are your flesh and bone. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,"2 In the recent past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led the Israelite army. Yahweh said to you, 'You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become ruler over Israel.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,"3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them before Yahweh. They anointed David king over Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,"4 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,"5 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,"6 The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land. They said to David, “You will not come here except to be turned away by the blind and the lame. David cannot come here.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,"7 Nevertheless, David captured the stronghold of Zion, which now is the city of David. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,"8 At that time David said, “Those who attack the Jebusites will have to go through the water shaft to reach the 'lame and the blind' who are David's enemies.” That is why people say, “The 'blind and the lame' must not enter the palace.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,"9 So David lived in the stronghold and called it the city of David. He fortified around it, from the terrace toward the inside. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,"10 David became very powerful because Yahweh, the God of hosts, was with him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,"11 Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, carpenters, and masons. They built a house for David. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,"12 David knew that Yahweh had established him as king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,"13 After David left Hebron and came to Jerusalem, he took more concubines and wives in Jerusalem, and more sons and daughters were born to him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,"14 These were the names of the children who were born to him in Jerusalem Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,"15 Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,"16 Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,"17 Now when the Philistines heard that David had been anointed as king over Israel, they all went out looking for him. But David heard about it and went down to the stronghold. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,18 Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,"19 Then David asked for help from Yahweh. He said, “Should I attack the Philistines? Will you give victory over them?” Yahweh said to David, “Attack, for I will certainly give you victory over the Philistines.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,"20 So David attacked at Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He commented, “Yahweh has burst through my enemies before me like a bursting flood of water.” So the name of that place became Baal Perazim. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,"21 The Philistines left their idols there, and David and his men carried them away. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,22 Then the Philistines came up again and spread out once more in the Valley of Rephaim. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,"23 So David sought help from Yahweh again, and Yahweh said to him, “You must not attack their front, but rather circle around behind them and come on them through the balsam woods. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,"24 When you hear the sound of marching in the wind blowing through the balsam treetops, then attack with force. Do this because Yahweh will have gone out before you to attack the army of the Philistines.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,5,25 So David did as Yahweh had commanded him. He killed Philistines from Geba all the way to Gezer. 6 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,"1 Now David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,"2 David arose and went with all his men who were with him from Baalah in Judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of Yahweh of hosts, who sits enthroned over the cherubim. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,"3 They set the ark of God on a new cart. They brought it out of Abinadab's house, which was on a hill. Uzzah and Ahio, his sons, were guiding the new cart. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,4 They brought the cart out of Abinadab's house on the hill with the ark of God on it. Ahio was walking in front of the ark. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,"5 Then David and all the house of Israel began to play before Yahweh, celebrating with wooden instruments, harps, lyres, tambourines, rattles, and cymbals. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,"6 When they came to the threshing floor of Nakon, the oxen stumbled, and Uzzah reached out with his hand to grab the ark of God, and he took hold of it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,7 Then the anger of Yahweh burned against Uzzah. God attacked him there for his sin. Uzzah died there by the ark of God. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,"8 David was angry because Yahweh had attacked Uzzah, and he called the name of that place Perez Uzzah. That place is called Perez Uzza to this day. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,"9 David was afraid of Yahweh that day. He said, “How can the ark of Yahweh come to me?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,"10 So David was not willing to take the ark of Yahweh with him into the city of David. Instead, he put it aside in the house of Obed Edom the Gittite. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,11 The ark of Yahweh remained in the house of Obed Edom the Gittite for three months. So Yahweh blessed him and all his household. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,"12 Now King David was told, “Yahweh has blessed Obed Edom's house and everything that belongs to him because of the ark of God.” So David went and brought up the ark of God from Obed Edom's house to the city of David with joy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,"13 When those who were carrying the ark of Yahweh had gone six steps, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,14 David danced before Yahweh with all his might; he was wearing only a linen ephod. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,15 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Yahweh with shouting and the sound of trumpets. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,"16 Now as the ark of Yahweh came into the city of David, Michal, daughter of Saul, looked out the window. She saw King David leaping and dancing before Yahweh. Then she despised him in her heart. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,"17 They brought in the ark of Yahweh and put it in its place, in the middle of the tent that David had set up for it. Then David offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,"18 When David had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of hosts. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,"19 Then he distributed among all the people, the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, a loaf of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins. Then all the people left; each one returned to his own house. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,"20 Then David returned to bless his family. Michal, the daughter of Saul, came out to meet David and said, “How honored the king of Israel was today, who undressed himself today before the eyes of the slave girls among his servants, like one of the crude fellows who shamelessly undresses himself!” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,"21 David responded to Michal, “I did that before Yahweh, who chose me above your father and above all his family, who appointed me leader over the people of Yahweh, over Israel. Before Yahweh I will be joyful! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,"22 I will be even more undignified than this, and I will be humiliated in my own eyes. But by these slave girls you have spoken about, I will be honored.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,6,"23 So Michal, the daughter of Saul, had no children to the day of her death. 7 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"1 It happened that after the king had settled in his house, and after Yahweh had given him rest from all his surrounding enemies, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"2 the king said to Nathan the prophet, “Look, I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of God is staying in the middle of a tent.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"3 Then Nathan said to the king, “Go, do what is in your heart, for Yahweh is with you.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"4 But that same night the word of Yahweh came to Nathan, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"5 “Go and tell David my servant, 'This is what Yahweh says Will you build me a house in which to live? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"6 For I have not lived in a house from the day that I brought up the people of Israel out of Egypt until this present day; instead, I have been moving about in a tent, a tabernacle. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"7 In all places where I have moved among all the people of Israel, did I ever say anything to any of Israel's leaders whom I appointed to shepherd my people Israel, saying, “Why have you not built me a house of cedar?”'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"8 Now then, tell my servant David, “This is what Yahweh of hosts says 'I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, so that you would be ruler over my people Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"9 I have been with you wherever you went. I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name great, like the names of the great ones of the earth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"10 I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them there, so that they may live in their own place and be troubled no more. No longer will wicked people oppress them, as they did before, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"11 as they were doing from the days that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Now I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover, I, Yahweh declare to you that I will make you a house. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"12 When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up a descendant after you, one who will come out from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"13 He will build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"14 I will be a father to him, and he will be my son. When he sins, I will discipline him with the rod of men and with the whipping of the sons of men. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"15 But my covenant faithfulness will not leave him, as I took it from Saul, whom I removed from before you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,16 Your house and kingdom will be confirmed forever before you. Your throne will be established forever.'” 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"17 Nathan spoke to David and reported to him all these words, and he told him about the entire vision. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"18 Then David the king went in and sat before Yahweh and said, “Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my family that you have brought me to this point? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"19 Now this was a small thing in your sight, Lord Yahweh. You have even spoken about your servant's family for a great while to come, and have shown me future generations, Lord Yahweh! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"20 What more can I, David, say to you? You have known your servant, Lord Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"21 For your word's sake, and to fulfill your own purpose, you have done this great thing and revealed it to your servant. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"22 Therefore you are great, Lord Yahweh, for there is no one like you, and there is no God besides you, as we have heard with our own ears. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"23 What nation is like your people Israel, the one nation on earth whom you, God, went and rescued for yourself? You did this so that they would become a people for yourself, to make a name for yourself, and to do great and fearful deeds for your land. You drove out nations and their gods from before your people, whom you rescued from Egypt. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"24 You established Israel as your own people forever, and you, Yahweh, became their God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"25 So now, Yahweh God, may the promise that you made concerning your servant and his family be established forever. Do as you have spoken. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"26 May your name be forever great, so the people will say, 'Yahweh of hosts is the God of Israel,' while the house of me, David, your servant is established before you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"27 For you, Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. That is why I, your servant, have found courage to pray to you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"28 Now, Lord Yahweh, you are God, and your words are trustworthy, and you have made this good promise to your servant. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,7,"29 Now then, let it please you to bless the house of your servant, so that it may continue forever before you. For you, Lord Yahweh, have said these things, and with your blessing your servant's house will be blessed forever.” 8 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,8,1 After this it came about that David attacked the Philistines and defeated them. So David took Metheg Ammah from the control of the Philistines. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,8,"2 Then he defeated Moab and measured their men with a line by making them lie down on the ground. He measured off two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. So the Moabites became servants to David and began to pay him tribute. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,8,"3 David then defeated Hadadezer son of Rehob, the king of Zobah, as Hadadezer was traveling to recover his rule by the Euphrates River. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,8,"4 David captured from him 1,"

Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,8,"5 When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David killed twenty-two thousand Aramean men. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,8,"6 Then David put garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans became servants to him and brought him tribute. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,8,7 David took the golden shields that were on Hadadezer's servants and brought them to Jerusalem. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,8,"8 From Tebah and Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took very much bronze. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,8,"9 When Tou, king of Hamath, heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,8,"10 Tou sent Hadoram his son to King David to greet him and to bless him, because David had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him, and because Hadadezer had waged war against Tou. Hadoram brought with himself objects of silver, gold, and bronze. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,8,"11 King David set aside these objects to Yahweh, together with the silver and gold from all the nations that he conquered— "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,8,"12 from Aram, Moab, the people of Ammon, the Philistines, and Amalek, along with all of the plundered goods of Hadadezer son of Rehob, the king of Zobah. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,9,"1 David said, “Is there anyone left in Saul's family to whom I may show kindness for Jonathan's sake?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,9,"2 There was in Saul's family a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David. The king said to him, “Are you Ziba?” He replied, “Yes. I am your servant.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,9,"3 So the king said, “Is there not anyone left of Saul's family to whom I may show the kindness of God?” Ziba replied to the king, “Jonathan still has a son, who is lame in his feet.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,9,"4 The king said to him, “Where is he?” Ziba replied to the king, “Look, he is in the house of Machir son of Ammiel in Lo Debar.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,9,5 Then King David sent and had him brought out of the house of Machir son of Ammiel from Lo Debar. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,9,"6 So Mephibosheth son of Jonathan son of Saul, came to David and bowed down his face to the floor in honor of David. David said, “Mephibosheth.” He answered, “See, I am your servant!” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,9,"7 David said to him, “Do not be afraid, for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father's sake, and I will restore to you all the land of Saul your grandfather, and you will always eat at my table.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,9,"8 Mephibosheth bowed and said, “What is your servant, that you should look with favor on such a dead dog as I am?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,9,"9 Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, “All that belonged to Saul and his family I have given to your master's grandson. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,9,"10 You, your sons, and your servants must till the land for him and you must harvest the crops so that your master's grandson will have food to eat. For Mephibosheth, your master's grandson, must always eat at my table.” Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,9,"11 Then Ziba said to the king, “Your servant will do all that my master the king commands his servant.” The king added, “As for Mephibosheth * he will eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,9,12 Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mika. All who lived in the house of Ziba were servants of Mephibosheth. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,9,"13 So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, and he always ate at the king's table, though he was lame in both his feet. 10 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,10,"1 It came about later that the king of the people of Ammon died, and that Hanun his son became king in his place. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,10,"2 David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent his servants to comfort Hanun concerning his father. His servants entered the land of the people of Ammon. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,10,"3 But the leaders of the people of Ammon said to Hanun their master, “Do you really think that David is honoring your father because he has sent men to comfort you? Has not David sent his servants to you to look at the city, to spy it out, in order to overthrow it?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,10,"4 So Hanun took David's servants, shaved off half their beards, cut off their garments up to their buttocks, and sent them away. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,10,"5 When they explained this to David, he sent to meet with them, for the men were deeply ashamed. The king said, “Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown back, and then return.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,10,"6 When the people of Ammon saw that they had become a stench to David, the people of Ammon sent messengers and hired the Arameans of Beth Rehob and Zobah, twenty thousand foot soldiers, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and the men of Tob with twelve thousand men. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,10,"7 When David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of soldiers. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,10,"8 The Ammonites came out and formed a line of battle at the entrance to their city gate, while the Arameans of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, stood by themselves in the open fields. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,10,"9 When Joab saw the battle lines facing him both in front and behind, he chose some of Israel's best fighters and arranged them against the Arameans. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,10,"10 The rest of his people he put into the hand of Abishai his brother, and he set them out in position to fight against the army of Ammon. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,10,"11 Joab said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you, Abishai, must rescue me. But if the army of Ammon is too strong for you, then I will come and rescue you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,10,"12 Be strong, and let us show ourselves to be strong for our people and for the cities of our God, for Yahweh will do what is good for his purpose.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,10,"13 So Joab and the soldiers of his army advanced to the battle against the Arameans, who were forced to flee before the army of Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,10,"14 When the army of Ammon saw that the Arameans had fled, they also fled from Abishai and went back into the city. Then Joab returned from the people of Ammon and went back to Jerusalem. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,10,"15 When the Arameans saw that they were being defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together again. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,10,"16 Then Hadarezer sent for Aramean troops from beyond the Euphrates River. They came to Helam, and Shobak, the commander of Hadarezer's army, went before them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,10,"17 When David was told this, he gathered all Israel together, crossed the Jordan, and arrived at Helam. The Arameans arranged themselves in battle lines against David and fought him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,10,"18 The Arameans fled from Israel, and David killed seven hundred of their men in chariots and forty thousand horsemen. Shobak the commander of their army was wounded and died there. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,10,"19 When all the kings who were servants of Hadarezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and became their subjects. So the Arameans were afraid to help the people of Ammon anymore."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"1 It came about in the springtime, at the time when kings normally go to war, that David sent out Joab, his servants, and all the army of Israel. They destroyed the army of Ammon and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed in Jerusalem. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"2 So it came about one evening that David got up from his bed and walked on the roof of his palace. From there he happened to see a woman who was bathing, and the woman was very beautiful to look at. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"3 So David sent and he asked people who would know about the woman. Someone said, “Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, and is she not the wife of Uriah the Hittite?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"4 David sent messengers and took her; she came in to him, and he slept with her (for she had just purified herself from menstruation). Then she returned to her house. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"5 The woman conceived, and she sent and told David; she said, “I am pregnant.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"6 Then David sent to Joab saying, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” So Joab sent Uriah to David. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"7 When Uriah arrived, David asked him how Joab was, how the army was doing, and how the war was going. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"8 David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house and wash your feet.” So Uriah left the king's palace, and the king sent a gift for Uriah after he left. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"9 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's palace with all the servants of his master, and he did not go down to his house. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"10 When they told David, “Uriah did not go down to his house,” David said to Uriah, “Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"11 Uriah answered David, “The ark, and Israel and Judah are staying in tents, and my master Joab and my master's servants are camped in an open field. How then can I go into my house to eat and to drink and to sleep with my wife? As sure as you are alive, I will not do this.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"12 So David said to Uriah, “Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you leave.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next day. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"13 When David called him, he ate and drank before him, and David made him drunk. At evening Uriah went out to sleep on his bed with the servants of his master; he did not go down to his house. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"14 So in the morning David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"15 David wrote in the letter saying, “Set Uriah at the very front of the most intense battle, and then withdraw from him, that he may be hit and killed.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"16 So as Joab watched the siege upon the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew the strongest enemy soldiers would be fighting. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"17 When the men of the city went out and fought against Joab's army, some of the soldiers of David fell, and Uriah the Hittite was also killed there. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"18 When Joab sent word to David about everything concerning the war, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"19 he commanded the messenger, saying, “When you have finished telling all the things concerning the war to the king, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"20 it may happen that the king will become angry, and he will say to you, 'Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"21 Who killed Abimelech son of Jerub-Besheth? Did not a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?' Then you must answer, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,22 So the messenger left and went to David and told him everything that Joab had sent him to say. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"23 Then the messenger said to David, “The enemy were stronger than we were at first; they came out to us into the field, but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"24 Then their shooters shot at your soldiers from off the wall, and some of the king's servants were killed, and your servant Uriah the Hittite was killed too.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"25 Then David said to the messenger, “Say this to Joab, 'Do not let this displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make your battle even stronger against the city, and overthrow it,' and encouragehim.”"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"26 So when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she lamented deeply for her husband. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,11,"27 When her sorrow passed, David sent and took her home to his palace, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But what David had done displeased Yahweh. 12 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"1 Then Yahweh sent Nathan to David. He came to him and said, “There were once two men in a city. One man was rich and the other poor. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"2 The rich man had huge numbers of flocks and herds, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"3 but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and fed and raised. It grew up together with him and with his children. The lamb even ate with him and drank from his own cup, and it slept in his arms and was like a daughter to him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"4 One day a visitor came to the rich man, but the rich man was unwilling to take an animal from his own flocks and herds to provide food for him. Instead he took the poor man's ewe lamb and cooked it for his visitor.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"5 David was hot with anger against the rich man, and he raged to Nathan, “As Yahweh lives, the man who has done this deserves to be put to death. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"6 He must pay back the lamb four times over because he did such a thing, and because he had no pity on the poor man.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"7 Then Nathan said to David, “You are that man! Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, 'I anointed you king over Israel, and I rescued you out of the hand of Saul. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"8 I gave you your master's house, and your master's wives into your arms. I also gave you the house of Israel and Judah. But if that had been too little, I would have given you many other things in addition. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"9 So why have you despised the commands of Yahweh, so as to do what is evil in his sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and have taken his wife to be your own wife. You killed him with the sword of the army of Ammon. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"10 So now the sword will never leave your house, because you have despised me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite as your wife.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"11 Yahweh says, 'Look, I will raise up disaster against you out of your own house. Before your own eyes, I will take your wives and give them to your neighbor, and he will sleep with your wives in broad daylight. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"12 For you committed your sin secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, in the sunlight.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"13 Then David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against Yahweh.” Nathan replied to David, “Yahweh also has passed over your sin. You will not be killed. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"14 However, because by this act you have despised Yahweh, the child who is born to you will surely die.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"15 Then Nathan left and went home. Yahweh attacked the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and he was very sick. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,16 David then implored God for the boy. David fasted and went inside and lay all night on the floor. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"17 The elders of his house arose and stood beside him, to raise him up from the floor, but he would not get up, and he would not eat with them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"18 It came about on the seventh day that the child died. David's servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, “Look, while the child was still alive we spoke to him, and he did not listen to our voice. What might he do to himself if we tell him that the boy is dead?!” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"19 But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead. He said to his servants, “Is the child dead?” They answered, “He is dead.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"20 Then David arose from the floor and washed himself, anointed himself, and changed his clothes. He went to the tabernacle of Yahweh and worshiped there, and then he came back to his own palace. When he asked for it, they set food before him, and he ate. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"21 Then his servants said to him, “Why have you done this? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive, but when thechild died, you got up and ate.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"22 David answered, “While the child was still alive I fasted and wept. I said, 'Who knows whether or not Yahweh will be gracious to me, that the child may live?' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"23 But now he is dead, so why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"24 David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and slept with her. Later she gave birth to a son, and the child was named Solomon. Yahweh loved him "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"25 and he sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah, because Yahweh loved him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"26 Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites, and he captured the royal city. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"27 So Joab sent messengers to David and said, “I have fought against Rabbah, and I have taken the city's water supply. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"28 Now therefore gather the rest of the army together and camp against the city and take it, because if I take the city, it will be named after me.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,29 So David gathered all the army together and went to Rabbah; he fought against the city and captured it. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"30 David took the crown from their king's head—it weighed a talent of gold, and there was a precious stone in it. The crown was placed on David's own head. Then he brought out the plunder of the city in large quantities. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,12,"31 He brought out the people who were in the city and forced them to work with saws, iron picks, and axes; he also made them work at brick kilns. David required all the cities of the people of Ammon to do this labor. Then David and all the army returned to Jerusalem. 13 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"1 It came about after this that Amnon son of David was very attracted to his beautiful half-sister Tamar, who was a full sister of Absalom, another of David's sons. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"2 Amnon was so frustrated that he became sick because of his sister Tamar. She was a virgin, and it seemed impossible to Amnon to do anything to her. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"3 But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother. Jonadab was a very shrewd man. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"4 Jonadab said to Amnon, “Why, son of the king, are you depressed every morning? Will you not tell me?” So Amnon answered him, “I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"5 Then Jonadab said to him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, ask him, 'Would you please send my sister Tamar to give me something to eat and cook it before me, so that I may see it and eat it from her hand?'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"6 So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please send my sister Tamar to make some food for my sickness in front of me so that I may eat from her hand.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"7 Then David sent word to Tamar at his palace, saying, “Go now to your brother Amnon's house and prepare food for him.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"8 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house where he was lying down. She took dough and kneaded it and formed bread in his sight, and then she baked it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"9 She took the pan and gave the bread to him, but he refused to eat. Then Amnon said to the others present, “Send everyone out, away from me.” So everyone went out from him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"10 So Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into my room that I may eat from your hand.” So Tamar took the bread that she had made, and brought it into the room of Amnon her brother. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"11 When she had brought the food to him, he took hold of her and said to her, “Come, sleep with me, my sister.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"12 She answered him, “No, my brother, do not force me, for nothing like this should be done in Israel. Do not do this appalling thing! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"13 How could I be rid of my shame? What about you? You would be like one of the fools in Israel! Now, please speak to the king, for he would not keep me from you.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"14 However Amnon would not listen to her. Since he was stronger than Tamar, he seized her and he slept with her. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"15 Then Amnon hated Tamar with extreme hatred. He hated her even more than he had desired her. Amnon said to her, “Get up and go.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"16 But she responded to him, “No! Because this great evil of making me leave is even worse than what you did to me!” But Amnon did not listen to her. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"17 Instead, he called his personal servant and said, “Take this woman away from me, and bolt the door after her.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,18 Then his servant brought her out and bolted the door after her. Tamar was wearing a very decorated robe because the king's daughters who were virgins dressed that way. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"19 Tamar put ashes on her head and tore her robe. She put her hands on her head and walked away, crying aloud as she went. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"20 Absalom her brother said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now keep quiet, my sister. He is your brother. Do not take this thing to heart.” So Tamar remained alone in her brother Absalom's house. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"21 But when King David heard of all these things, he was very angry. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"22 Absalom said nothing to Amnon, for Absalom hated him for what he had done to her and how he had disgraced his sister Tamar. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"23 It came about after two full years that Absalom had sheep shearers working at Baal Hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king's sons to visit there. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"24 Absalom went to the king and said, “Look now, your servant has sheep shearers. Please, may the king and his servants go with me, your servant.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"25 The king answered Absalom, “No, my son, all of us should not go because we would be a burden to you.” Absalom begged the king, but he would not go, but he gave him his blessing. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"26 Then Absalom said, “If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.” So the king said to him, “Why should Amnon go with you?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"27 Absalom pressed David, and so he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"28 Absalom commanded his servants saying, “Listen closely. When Amnon begins to be affected by the wine, and when I say to you, 'Attack Amnon,' then kill him. Do not be afraid. Have I not commanded you? Be courageous and brave.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"29 So Absalom's servants did to Amnon as he had commanded them. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man mounted his mule and fled. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"30 So it came about, while they were on the road, that the news came to David saying, “Absalom has killed all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"31 Then the king arose and tore his clothes, and lay on the floor; all his servants stood by with their clothes torn. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"32 Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother, answered and said, “Let not my master believe that they have killed all the young men who are the king's sons, for Amnon only is dead. Absalom has planned this from the day that Amnon violated his sister Tamar. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"33 So therefore let not my master the king take this report to heart, so as to believe that all the king's sons are dead, for Amnon only is dead.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,34 Absalom fled away. A servant keeping watch raised his eyes and saw many people coming on the road on the hillside west of him. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"35 Then Jonadab said to the king, “Look, the king's sons are coming. It is just as your servant said.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"36 So it came about when he finished speaking, the king's sons arrived and raised their voices and wept. The king and all his servants also wept bitterly. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"37 But Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. David mourned for his son every day. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"38 So Absalom fled and went to Geshur, where he was for three years. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,13,"39 The mind of King David longed to go out to see Absalom, for he was comforted concerning Amnon and his death."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,1 Now Joab son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart desired to see Absalom. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"2 So Joab sent word to Tekoa and had a wise woman brought to him. He said to her, “Please pretend you are a mourner and put on mourning clothes. Please do not anoint yourself with oil, but be like a woman who has mourned a long time for the dead. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,3 Then go to the king and speak to him about what I will describe.” So Joab told her the words she was to say to the king. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"4 When the woman from Tekoa spoke to the king, she lay facedown on the ground and said, “Help me, king.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"5 The king said to her, “What is wrong?” She answered, “The truth is that I am a widow, and my husband is dead. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"6 I, your servant, had two sons, and they fought together in the field, and there was no one to separate them. One struck the other and killed him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"7 Now the whole clan has risen against your servant, and they say, 'Give into our hand the man who struck his brother, so that we may put him to death, to pay for the life of his brother whom he killed.' So they would also destroy the heir. Thus they will put out the burning coal that I have left, and they will leave for my husband neither name nor descendant on the surface of the earth.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"8 So the king said to the woman, “Go to your house, and I will command something to be done for you.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"9 The woman of Tekoa replied to the king, “My master, king, may the guilt be on me and on my father's family. The king and his throne are guiltless.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"10 The king replied, “Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me, and he will not touch you anymore.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"11 Then she said, “Please, may the king call to mind Yahweh your God, so that the avenger of blood will not destroy anyone further, so that they will not destroy my son.” The king replied, “As Yahweh lives, not one hair of your son will fall to the ground.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"12 Then the woman said, “Please let your servant speak a further word to my master the king.” He said, “Speak on.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"13 So the woman said, “Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of God? For in saying this thing, the king is like someone who is guilty, because the king has not brought back home again his banished son. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"14 For we all must die, and we are like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. But God will not take away life; instead, he finds a way for those who were driven away to be restored. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"15 Now then, seeing that I have come to speak this thing to my master the king, it is because the people have made me afraid. So your servant said to herself, 'I will now speak to the king. It may be that the king will perform the request of his servant. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"16 Perhaps the king will listen to me and deliver his servant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together, out of the inheritance God gave us.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"17 Then your servant prayed, 'Yahweh, please let the word of my master the king give me relief, for as an angel of God, so is my master the king in telling good from evil.' May Yahweh your God be with you.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"18 Then the king answered and said to the woman, “Please do not hide from me anything that I will ask you.” The woman replied, “Let my master the king now speak.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"19 The king said, “Is not the hand of Joab with you in all this?” The woman answered and said, “As you live, my master the king, no one can escape to the right hand or to the left from anything that my master the king has spoken. It was your servant Joab who commanded me and told me to say these things that your servant has spoken. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"20 Your servant Joab has done this to change the course of what is happening. My master is wise, like the wisdom of an angel of God, and he knows everything that is happening in the land.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"21 So the king said to Joab, “Look now, I will do this thing. Go then, and bring the young man Absalom back.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"22 So Joab lay facedown on the ground in honor and gratitude to the king. Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have foundfavor in your eyes, my master, king, in that the king has performed the requestof his servant.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"23 So Joab arose, went to Geshur, and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"24 The king said, “He may return to his own house, but he may not see my face.” So Absalom returned to his own house, but did not see the king's face. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,25 Now in all Israel there was no one praised for his handsomeness more than Absalom. From the sole of his foot to the top of his head there was no blemish in him. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"26 When he cut the hair of his head at the end of every year, because it was heavy on him, he weighed his hair; it would weigh about two hundred shekels, which is measured by the weight of the king's standard. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"27 To Absalom were born three sons and one daughter, whose name was Tamar. She was a beautiful woman. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"28 Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, without seeing the king's face. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"29 Then Absalom sent word for Joab to send him to the king, but Joab would not come to him. So Absalom sent word a second time, but Joab still did not come. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"30 So Absalom said to his servants, “See, Joab's field is near mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire.” So Absalom's servants set the field on fire. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"31 Then Joab arose and came to Absalom at his house, and said to him, “Why have your servants set my field on fire?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"32 Absalom answered Joab, “Look, I sent word to you saying, 'Come here so I may send you to the king to say, “Why did I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to still be there. Now therefore let me see the king's face, and if I am guilty, let him kill me.”'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,14,"33 So Joab went to the king and told him. When the king called for Absalom, he came to the king and bowed low to the ground before the king, and the king kissed Absalom. 15 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"1 It came about after this that Absalom prepared a chariot and horses for himself, with fifty men to run before him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"2 Absalom would get up early and stand beside the road leading to the city gate. When any man had a dispute to come to the king for judgment, Absalom called to him and said, “From what city have you come?” Then the man would answer, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"3 So Absalom would say to him, “Look, your case is good and right, but there is no one empowered by the king to hear your case.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"4 Absalom added, “I wish that I were made judge in the land, so that every man who had any dispute or cause might come to me, and I would bring him justice!” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"5 So it came about that when any man came to Absalom to honor him, Absalom would put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,6 Absalom acted in this way to all Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"7 It came about at the end of four years that Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go and pay a vow that I have made to Yahweh in Hebron. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"8 For your servant made a vow while I was living at Geshur in Aram, saying,' If Yahweh will indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will worship Yahweh.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"9 So the king said to him, “Go in peace.” So Absalom arose and went to Hebron. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"10 But then Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you must say, 'Absalom is king in Hebron.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"11 With Absalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem, who were invited. They went in their innocence, not knowing anything that Absalom had planned. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"12 While Absalom offered sacrfices, he sent for Ahithophel from his hometown of Giloh. He was David's counselor. Absalom's conspiracy was strong, for the people following Absalom were constantly increasing."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"13 A messenger came to David saying, “The hearts of the men of Israel are following after Absalom.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"14 So David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, “Arise and let us flee, or none of us will escape from Absalom. Prepare to leave immediately, or he will quickly overtake us, and he will bring down disaster on us and attack the city with the edge of the sword.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"15 The king's servants said to the king, “Look, your servants are ready to do whatever our master the king decides.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"16 The king left and all his family after him, but the king left ten women, who were concubines, to keep the palace. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"17 After the king went out and all the people after him, they stopped at the last house. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"18 All his army marched with him, and before him went all the Kerethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites—six hundred men who had followed him from Gath. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"19 Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why will you come with us? Return and stay with the king, for you are a foreigner and an exile. Return to your own place. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"20 Since you just left yesterday, why should I make you wander all over with us? I do not even know where I am going. So return and take your fellow countrymen back. May loyalty and faithfulness go with you.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"21 But Ittai answered the king and said, “As Yahweh lives, and as my master the king lives, surely in whatever place where my master the king goes, there also will your servant go, whether that means living or dying.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"22 So David said to Ittai, “Go ahead and continue with us.” So Ittai the Gittite marched with the king, along with all his men and all the families who were with him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"23 All the country wept with a loud voice as all the people passed by over the Kidron Valley, and as the king also himself crossed over. All the people traveled on the road toward the wilderness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"24 Even Zadok with all the Levites, carrying the ark of the covenant of God, were present. They set the ark of God down, and then Abiathar joined them. They waited until all the people had passed by out of the city. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"25 The king said to Zadok, “Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of Yahweh, he will bring me back here and show me again the ark and the place where he lives. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"26 But if he says, 'I am not pleased with you,' look, here am I, let him do to me whatever seems good to him.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"27 The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Are you not a seer? Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan son of Abiathar. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"28 See, I will wait at the fords of the Arabah until word comes from you to inform me.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"29 So Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back into Jerusalem, and they stayed there. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"30 But David ascended barefoot and weeping up the Mount of Olives, and he had his head covered. Every man of the people who were with him covered his head, and they went up weeping as they walked. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"31 Someone told David saying, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.” So David prayed, “O Yahweh, please turn Ahithophel's advice into foolishness.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"32 It came about that when David arrived at the top of the road, where God used to be worshiped, Hushai the Arkite came to meet him with his coat torn and earth on his head. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"33 David said to him, “If you travel with me, then you will be a burden to me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"34 But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, 'I will be your servant, king, as I have been your father's servant in time past, so will I now be your servant,' then you will confuse Ahithophel's advice for me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"35 Will you not have the priests Zadok and Abiathar with you? So whatever you hear in the king's palace, you must tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"36 See that they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son. You must send to me by their hand everything that you hear.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,15,"37 So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city as Absalom arrived and entered into Jerusalem."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,"1 When David had gone a short distance over the summit of the hill, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of saddled donkeys; on them were two hundred loaves of bread, one hundred clusters of raisins, and one hundred bunches of figs, and a skin of wine. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,"2 The king said to Ziba, “Why did you bring these things?” Ziba replied, “The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on, the bread and fig cakes are for your men to eat, and the wine is for anyone who is faint in the wilderness to drink.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,"3 The king said, “Then where is your master's grandson?” Ziba replied to the king, “Look, he has stayed behind in Jerusalem, for he said, 'Today the house of Israel will restore my father's kingdom to me.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,"4 Then the king said to Ziba, “Look, all that belonged to Mephibosheth now belongs to you.” Ziba answered, “I bow in humility to you, my master, king. Let me find favor in your eyes.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,"5 When King David approached Bahurim, there came out from there a man from the clan of Saul, whose name was Shimei son of Gera. He came out cursing as he walked. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,"6 He threw stones at David and at all of the king's officials, in spite of the army and bodyguards who were on the king's right and left. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,"7 Shimei called out in cursing, “Go away, get out of here, you villain, you man of blood! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,"8 Yahweh has repaid all of you for the blood you shed within the family of Saul, in whose place you have reigned. Yahweh has given the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son. You have come to ruin because you are a man of blood.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,"9 Then Abishai son of Zeruiah, said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my master the king? Please let me go over and take off his head.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,"10 But the king said, “What have I to do with you, sons of Zeruiah? Perhaps he is cursing me because Yahweh has said to him, 'Curse David.' Who then could say to him, 'Why are you cursing the king?'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,"11 So David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “Look, my son, who was born from my body, wants to take my life. How much more may this Benjamite now desire my ruin? Leave him alone and let him curse, for Yahweh has commanded him to do it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,"12 Perhaps Yahweh will look at the misery unleashed on me, and repay me with good for his cursing me today.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,"13 So David and his men traveled on the road, while Shimei went beside him up on the hillside, cursing and throwing dust and stones at him as he went. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,"14 Then the king and all the people who were with him became weary, and he rested when they stopped for the night. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,"15 As for Absalom and all the men of Israel who were with him, they came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,"16 It came about when Hushai the Arkite, David's friend, had come to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the king! Long live the king!” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,"17 Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with him?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,"18 Hushai said to Absalom, “No! Instead, the one whom Yahweh and this people and all the men of Israel have chosen, that is the man to whom I will belong, and I will stay with him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,"19 Also, what man should I serve? Should I not serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father's presence, I will serve in your presence.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,"20 Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give us your advice about what we should do.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,"21 Ahithophel answered Absalom, “Go sleep with your father's slave wives whom he has left to keep the palace, and all Israel will hear that you have become a stench to your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,"22 So they spread for Absalom a tent on the top of the palace, and Absalom slept with his father's slave wives in the sight of all Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,16,23 Now the advice of Ahithophel that he gave in those days was as if a man heard from the mouth of God himself. That was how all of Ahithophel's advice was viewed by both Davidand Absalom.
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"1 Then Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Now let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue David tonight. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"2 I will come on him while he is weary and weak and will surprise him with fear. The people who are with him will flee, and I will attack only the king. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"3 I will bring back all the people to you, like a bride coming to her husband, and all the people will be at peace under you.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,4 What Ahithophel said pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"5 Then Absalom said, “Now call Hushai the Arkite, too, and let us hear what he says.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"6 When Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom explained to him what Ahithophel had said and then asked Hushai, “Should we do what Ahithophel has said? If not, tell us what you advise.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"7 So Hushai said to Absalom, “The advice that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"8 Hushai added, “You know your father and his men are strong warriors, and that they are bitter, and they are like a bear robbed of her cubs in a field. Your father is a man of war; he will not sleep with the army tonight. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"9 Look, right now he is probably hidden in some pit or in some other place. It will happen that when some of your men have been killed at the beginning of an attack, that whoever hears it will say, 'A slaughter has taken place among the soldiers who follow Absalom.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"10 Then even the bravest soldiers, whose hearts are like the heart of a lion, will be afraid because all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and that the men who are with him are very strong. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"11 So I advise you that all Israel should be gathered together to you, from Dan to Beersheba, as numerous as the sands that are by the sea, and that you go to battle in person. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"12 Then we will come on him wherever he may be found, and we will cover him as the dew falls on the ground. We will not leave even one of his men, or him himself, alive. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"13 If he retreats into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city and we will drag it into the river, until there is no longer even a small stone found there.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"14 Then Absalom and the men of Israel said, “Hushai the Arkite's advice is better than Ahithophel's.” Yahweh had ordained the rejection of Ahithophel's good advice in order to bring destruction on Absalom. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"15 Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, “Ahithophel advised Absalom and the elders of Israel in such and such a way, but I have advised something else. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"16 Now then, go quickly and report to David; say to him, 'Do not camp tonight at the fords of the Arabah, but by all means cross over, or the king will be swallowed up along with all the people who are with him.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"17 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at the spring of Rogel. A female servant used to go and inform them what they needed to know, for they could not risk being seen going into the city. When the message came, then they were to go and tell King David. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"18 But a young man saw them this time and told Absalom. So Jonathan and Ahimaaz went away quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his courtyard, into which they descended. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"19 The man's wife took the covering for the well and spread it over the well's opening, and tossed grain over it, so no one knew Jonathan and Ahimaaz were in the well. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"20 Absalom's men came to the woman of the house and said, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” The woman told them, “They have crossed over the river.” So after they had looked around and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"21 It came about after they had left that Jonathan and Ahimaaz came up out of the well. They went to report to King David; they said to him, “Get up and cross quickly over the water because Ahithophel has given such and such adviceabout you.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"22 Then David arose and all the people who were with him, and they crossed over the Jordan. By morning daylight not one of them had failed to cross over the Jordan. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"23 When Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and left. He went home to his own city, set his affairs in order, and hanged himself. In this way he died and was buried in the tomb of his father. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"24 Then David came to Mahanaim. As for Absalom, he crossed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"25 Absalom had set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Amasa was the son of Jether the Ishmaelite *, who had slept with Abigail, who was the daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah, the mother of Joab. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,26 Then Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"27 It came about when David had come to Mahanaim, that Shobi son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and Machir son of Ammiel from Lo Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"28 brought sleeping mats and blankets, bowls and pots, and wheat, barley flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,17,"29 honey, butter, sheep, and milk curds, so that David and the people with him could eat. These men had said, “The people are hungry, weary, and thirsty in the wilderness.” 18 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,1 David counted the soldiers who were with him and appointed captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"2 Then David sent out the army, one-third under the command of Joab, another third under the command of Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and still another third under the command of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the army, “I will certainly go out with you myself, too.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"3 But the men said, “You must not go to battle, for if we flee away they will not care about us, or if half of us die they will not care. But you are worth ten thousand of us! Therefore it is better that you be ready to help us from the city.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"4 So the king answered them, “I will do whatever seems best to you.” The king stood by the city gate while all the army went out by hundreds and by thousands. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"5 The king commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai saying, “Deal gently for my sake with the young man, with Absalom.” All the people heard that the king had given the captains this command about Absalom. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,6 So the army went out into the countryside against Israel; the battle spread into the forest of Ephraim. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,7 The army of Israel was defeated there before the soldiers of David; there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"8 The battle spread throughout the whole countryside, and more men were consumed by the forest than by the sword. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"9 Absalom happened to meet some of David's soldiers. Absalom was riding his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak tree, and his head was caught up in the tree branches. He was left dangling between the ground and the sky while the mule he was riding kept going. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"10 Someone saw this and told Joab, “Look, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree!” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"11 Joab said to the man who told him about Absalom, “Look! You saw him! Why did you not strike him down to the ground? I would have given you ten silver shekels and a belt.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"12 The man replied to Joab, “Even if I received a thousand silver shekels, * still I would not have reached out my hand against the king's son, because weall heard the king command you, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, 'No one must touchthe young man Absalom.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"13 If I had risked my life by a falsehood (and there is nothing hidden from the king), you would have abandoned me.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"14 Then Joab said, “I will not wait for you.” So Joab took three javelins in his hand and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was still alive and hanging from the oak. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"15 Then ten young men who carried Joab's armor surrounded Absalom, attacked him, and killed him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"16 Then Joab blew the trumpet, and the army returned from pursuing Israel, for Joab held back the army. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"17 They took Absalom and threw him into a large pit in the forest; they buried his body under a very large pile of stones, while all Israel fled, every man to his own home. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"18 Now Absalom, while still alive, had built for himself a large stone pillar in the King's Valley, for he said, “I have no son to carry along the memory of my name.” He named the pillar after his own name, so it is called Absalom's Monument to this very day. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"19 Then Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, “Let me now run to the king with the good news, how Yahweh has rescued him from the hand of his enemies.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"20 Joab answered him, “You will not be the bearer of news today; you must do it another day. Today you will bear no news because the king's son is dead.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"21 Then Joab said to a Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen.” The Cushite bowed down to Joab, and ran. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"22 Then Ahimaaz son of Zadok said again to Joab, “Regardless of what may happen, please let me also run and follow the Cushite.” Joab replied, “Why do you want to run, my son, seeing that you will have no reward for the news?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"23 “Whatever happens,” said Ahimaaz, “I will run.” So Joab answered him, “Run.” Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and outran the Cushite. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"24 Now David was sitting between the inner and outer gates. The watchman had gone up to the roof of the gate to the wall and raised his eyes. As he looked, he saw a man approaching, running alone. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"25 The watchman shouted out and told the king. Then the king said, “If he is alone, there is news in his mouth.” The runner came closer and neared the city. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"26 Then the watchman noticed another man running, and the watchman called to the gatekeeper; he said, “Look, there is another man running alone.” The king said, “He is also bringing news.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"27 So the watchman said, “I think the running of the man in front is like the running of Ahimaaz son of Zadok.” The king said, “He is a good man and is coming with good news.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"28 Then Ahimaaz called out and said to the king, “All is well.” He bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground and said, “Blessed be Yahweh your God! He has delivered the men who lifted up their hand against my master the king.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"29 So the king replied, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” Ahimaaz answered, “When Joab sent me, the king's servant, to you, king, I saw a great disturbance, but I did not know what it was.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"30 Then the king said, “Turn aside and stand here.” So Ahimaaz turned aside, and stood still. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"31 Immediately then the Cushite arrived and said, “There is good news for my master the king, for Yahweh has avenged you today from all who rose up against you.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"32 Then the king said to the Cushite, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” The Cushite answered, “The enemies of my master the king, and all who rise up against you to do harm to you, should be as that young man is.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,18,"33 Then the king was deeply unnerved, and he went up to the room over the gate and wept. As he went he grieved, “My son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! I wish I had died instead of you, Absalom, my son, my son!”"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"1 Joab was told, “Look, the king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"2 So the victory that day was turned into mourning for all the army, for the army heard it said that day, “The king is mourning for his son.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"3 The soldiers had to sneak quietly into the city that day, like people who are ashamed sneak away when they run from battle. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"4 The king covered his face and cried in a loud voice, “My son Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son!” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"5 Then Joab entered into the house to the king and said to him, “You have shamed the faces of all your soldiers today, who have saved your life today, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your slave wives, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"6 because you love those who hate you, and you hate those who love you. For today you have shown that commanders and soldiers are nothing to you. Today I believe that if Absalom had lived, and we all had died, then that would have pleased you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"7 Now therefore get up and go out and speak kindly to your soldiers, for I swear by Yahweh, if you do not go, not one man will remain with you tonight. That would be worse for you than all the disasters that have ever happened to you from your youth until now.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"8 So the king got up and sat in the city gate, and all the people were told, “Look, the king is sitting in the gate,” and all the people came before the king. So Israel fled, every man to his home. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"9 All the people were arguing with each other throughout all the tribes of Israel saying, “The king rescued us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines, but now he has run out of the land because of Absalom. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"10 Absalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle. So why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"11 King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests saying, “Speak to the elders of Judah saying, 'Why are you the last to bring the king back to his palace, since the talk of all Israel favors the king, to bring him back to his palace? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"12 You are my brothers, my flesh and bone. Why then are you the last to bring back the king?' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"13 Then say to Amasa, 'Are you not my flesh and my bone? God do so to me, and more also, if you are not captain of my army from now on in the place of Joab.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"14 So he won the hearts of all the men of Judah as one man. They sent to the king saying, “Return, you and all your men.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,15 So the king returned and came to the Jordan. Now the men of Judah came to Gilgal to go to meet the king and then to bring the king across the Jordan. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"16 Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was from Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"17 There were one thousand men from Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of Saul, and his fifteen sons and twenty servants with him. They crossed through the Jordan in the presence of the king. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,18 They crossed to bring over the king's family and to do whatever he thought good. Shimei son of Gera bowed down before the king just before he began to cross the Jordan. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"19 Shimei said to the king, “Do not, my master, find me guilty or call to mind the wrong your servant did the day my master the king left Jerusalem. Please, may the king not take it to heart. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"20 For your servant knows that I have sinned. See, that is why I have come today as the first from all the family of Joseph to come down to meet my master the king.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"21 But Abishai son of Zeruiah answered and said, “Should not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed Yahweh's anointed?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"22 Then David said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should today be adversaries to me? Will any man be put to death today in Israel? For do I not know that today I am king over Israel?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"23 So the king said to Shimei, “You will not die.” So the king promised him with an oath."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"24 Then Mephibosheth son of Saul came down to meet the king. He had not dressed his feet, or trimmed his beard, or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he came home in peace. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"25 So when he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, “Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"26 He answered, “My master the king, my servant deceived me, for I said, 'I will saddle a donkey so I may ride on it and go with the king, because your servant is lame.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"27 My servant Ziba has slandered me, your servant, to my master the king. But my master the king is like an angel of God. Therefore, do what is good in your eyes. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"28 For all my father's house were dead men before my master the king, but you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. What right therefore have I that I should still cry any more to the king?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"29 Then the king said to him, “Why explain anything further? I have decided that you and Ziba will divide the fields.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"30 So Mephibosheth replied to the king, “Yes, let him take it all, since my master the king has come safely to his own home.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"31 Then Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim to cross over the Jordan with the king, and he accompanied the king over the Jordan. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"32 Now Barzillai was a very old man, eighty years old. He had furnished the king with provisions while he stayed at Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"33 The king said to Barzillai, “Come over with me, and I will provide for you to stay with me in Jerusalem.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"34 Barzillai replied to the king, “How many days are left in the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,35 I am eighty years old. Can I distinguish between good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should your servant be a burden to my master the king? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,36 Your servant would like to just go over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king repay me with such a reward? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"37 Please let your servant return back home, so I may die in my own city by the grave of my father and my mother. But see, here is your servant Kimham. Let him cross over with my master the king, and do for him what seems good to you.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"38 The king answered, “Kimham will go over with me, and I will do for him what seems good to you, and whatever you desire from me, I do that for you.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"39 Then all the people crossed the Jordan, and the king crossed over, and the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him. Then Barzillai returned to his own home. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"40 So the king crossed over to Gilgal, and Kimham crossed over with him. All the army of Judah brought the king over, and also half the army of Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"41 Soon all the men of Israel began to come to the king and say to the king, “Why have our brothers, the men of Judah, stolen you away and brought the king and his family over the Jordan, and all David's men with him?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"42 So the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “It is because the king is more closely related to us. Why then are you angry about this? Have we eaten anything that the king had to pay for? Has he given us any gifts?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,19,"43 The men of Israel answered the men of Judah, “We have ten tribes related to the king, so we have even more right to David than you. Why then did you despise us? Was not our proposal to bring back our king the first to be heard?” But the words of the men of Judah were even more harsh than the words of the men of Israel. 20 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,"1 There also happened to be at the same place a troublemaker whose name was Sheba son of Bikri, a Benjamite. He blew the trumpet and said, “We have no part in David, neither have we any inheritance in the son of Jesse. Let every man go back to his home, Israel.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,"2 So all the men of Israel deserted David and followed Sheba son of Bikri. But the men of Judah followed closely their king, from theJordan all the way to Jerusalem."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,"3 When David came to his palace at Jerusalem, he took the ten slave wives whom he had left to keep the palace, and he put them in a house under guard. He provided for their needs, but he did not sleep with them any longer. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living as if they were widows. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,"4 Then the king said to Amasa, “Call the men of Judah together within three days; you must be here, too.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,"5 So Amasa went to call Judah, but he was delayed beyond the time that the king had allotted for him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,"6 So David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba son of Bikri will do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your master's servants, my soldiers, and pursue after him, or he will find fortified cities and escape out of our sight.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,"7 Then Joab's men went out after him, along with the Kerethites and the Pelethites and all the mighty warriors. They left Jerusalem to pursue Sheba son of Bikri. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,"8 When they were at the great stone which is at Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was wearing the battle armor that he had put on, which included a belt around his waist with a sheathed sword fastened to it. As he walked forward, the sword fell out. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,"9 So Joab said to Amasa, “Is it well with you, my cousin?” Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,"10 Amasa did not notice the dagger that was in Joab's left hand. Joab stabbed Amasa in the stomach and his bowels spilled out to the ground. Joab did not strike him again, and Amasa died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba son of Bikri. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,"11 Then one of Joab's men stood by Amasa, and the man said, “He who favors Joab, and he who is for David, let him follow Joab.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,"12 Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the road. When the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa off of the road and into a field. He threw a garment over him because he saw that everyone who came by him stood still. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,"13 After Amasa was taken off the road, all the men followed on after Joab in pursuit of Sheba son of Bikri. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,"14 Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel of Beth Maacah, and through all the land of the Bikrites, who gathered together and also pursued Sheba. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,15 They caught up with him and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maacah. They built up a siege ramp against the city against the wall. All the army who were with Joab battered the wall to knock it down. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,"16 Then a wise woman cried out of the city, “Listen, please listen, Joab! Come near me so I may speak with you.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,"17 So Joab came near to her, and the woman said, “Are you Joab?” He answered, “I am.” Then she said to him, “Listen to the words of your servant.” He answered, “I am listening.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,"18 Then she spoke, “They used to say in old times, 'Surely seek advice at Abel,' and that advice would end the matter. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,19 We are a city that is one of the most peaceful and faithful in Israel. You are trying to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel. Why do you want to swallow up the inheritance of Yahweh?” 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,"20 So Joab answered and said, “Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,"21 That is not true. But a man from the hill country of Ephraim, named Sheba son of Bikri, has lifted up his hand against the king, against David. Give up him alone, and I will withdraw from the city.” The woman said to Joab, “His head will be thrown to you over the wall.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,"22 Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. They cut off the head of Sheba son of Bikri, and threw it out to Joab. Then he blew the trumpet and Joab's men left the city, every man to his home. Then Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,"23 Now Joab was over all the army of Israel, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and over the Pelethites. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,"24 Adoniram was over the men who did forced labor, and Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,25 Sheva was scribe and Zadok and Abiathar were priests. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,20,26 Ira the Jairite was chief minister to David. 21 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,21,"1 There was a famine in David's time for three years in a row, and David sought the face of Yahweh. So Yahweh said, “This famine is on you because of Saul and his murderous family, because he put the Gibeonites to death.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,21,"2 Now the Gibeonites were not from the people of Israel; they were from what remained of the Amorites. The people of Israel had sworn not to kill them, but Saul tried to kill them all anyway in his zeal for the people of Israel and Judah. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,21,"3 So King David called together the Gibeonites and said to them, “What should I do for you? How can I make atonement, so that you may bless the people of Yahweh, who inherit his goodness and promises?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,21,"4 The Gibeonites responded to him, “It is not a matter of silver or gold between us and Saul or his family. In the same way it is not for us to put to death any man in Israel.” David replied, “What are you saying that I should do for you?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,21,"5 They answered the king, “The man who tried to kill us all, who schemed against us, so that we are now destroyed and have no place within the borders of Israel— "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,21,"6 let seven men from his descendants be handed over to us, and we will hang them before Yahweh in Gibeah of Saul, the one chosen by Yahweh.” So the king said, “I will give them to you.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,21,"7 But the king spared Mephibosheth son of Jonathan son of Saul, because of Yahweh's oath between them, between David and Jonathan son of Saul. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,21,"8 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah daughter of Aiah, sons whom she bore to Saul —the two sons were named Armoni and Mephibosheth; and David also took the five sons of Merab * daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,21,"9 He handed them over into the hands of the Gibeonites. They hanged them on the mountain before Yahweh, and they died all seven together. They were put to death during the time of harvest, during the first days at the beginning of barley harvest. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,21,"10 Then Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the mountain beside the dead bodies, from the beginning of harvest until the rain poured down on them from the sky. She did not allow the birds of the sky to disturb the bodies by day or the wild animals by night. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,21,"11 It was told to David what Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, the slave wife of Saul, had done. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,21,"12 So David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh Gilead, who had stolen them from the public square of Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, after the Philistines had killed Saul in Gilboa. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,21,"13 David took away from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son, and they gathered the bones of the seven men who had been hanged, as well. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,21,"14 They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father. They performed all that the king commanded. After that God answered their prayers for the land. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,21,15 Then the Philistines went to war again with Israel. So David went down with his army and fought against the Philistines. David was overcome with battle fatigue. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,21,"16 Ishbi-Benob, a descendant of the giants, whose bronze spear weighed three hundred shekels, and who was armed with a new sword, intended to kill David. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,21,"17 But Abishai son of Zeruiah rescued David, attacked the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, “You must not go to battle anymore with us, so that you do not put out the lamp of Israel.” *"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,21,"18 It came about after this that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob, when Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was one of the descendants of the Rephaim. † "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,21,"19 It came about again in a battle with the Philistines at Gob, that Elhanan son of Jair the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,21,"20 It came about in another battle at Gath that there was a man of great height who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number. He also was descended from the Rephaim. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,21,"21 When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimeah, David's brother, killed him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,21,"22 These were descendants of the Rephaim of Gath, and they were killed by the hand of David and by the hand of his soldiers. 22 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,"1 David sang to Yahweh the words of this song on the day that Yahweh rescued him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,"2 He prayed, “Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, the one who rescues me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,"3 God is my rock. I take refuge in him. He is my shield, the horn of my salvation, my stronghold, and my refuge, the one who saves me from violence. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,"4 I will call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised, and I will be saved from my enemies. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,"5 For the waves of death surrounded me, the rushing waters of destruction overwhelmed me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,6 The cords of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of death trapped me. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,"7 In my distress I called to Yahweh; I called to my God; he heard my voice from his temple, and my call for help went into his ears. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,"8 Then the earth shook and trembled. The foundations of the heavens trembled and were shaken, because God was angry. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,"9 Smoke went up from out of his nostrils, and blazing fire came out of his mouth. Coals were ignited by it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,"10 He opened the heavens and came down, and thick darkness was under his feet. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,11 He rode on a cherub and flew. He was seen on the wings of the wind. *

Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,15 He shot arrows and scattered his enemies— lightning bolts and dispersed them. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,"16 Then the channels of the sea were seen; the foundations of the world were laid bare at the rebuke of Yahweh, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,17 He reached down from above; he took hold of me! † He pulled me out of the surging water.
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,"18 He rescued me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me, for they were too strong for me. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,20 He also brought me out to a wide open place. He saved me because he was pleased with me. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,21 Yahweh has rewarded me to the measure of my righteousness; he has restored me to the measure of the cleanness of my hands. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,22 For I have kept the ways of Yahweh and have not acted wickedly by turning from my God. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,"23 For all his righteous decrees have been before me; as for his statutes, I have not turned away from them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,"24 I have also been innocent before him, and I have kept myself from sin. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,"25 Therefore Yahweh has restored me to the measure of my righteousness, to the degree of my cleanness in his sight. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,"26 To one who is faithful, you show yourself to be faithful; to a man who is blameless, you show yourself to be blameless. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,"27 With the pure you show yourself pure, but you are perverse to the twisted. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,"28 You save afflicted people, but your eyes are against the proud, and you bring them down. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,"37 You have made a wide place for my feet beneath me, so my feet have not slipped. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,38 I pursued my enemies and destroyed them. I did not turn back until they were destroyed. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,39 I devoured them and smashed them; they cannot rise. They have fallen under my feet. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,40 You put strength on me like a belt for battle; you put under me those who rise up against me. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,22,41 You gave me the back of my enemies' necks; I annihilated those who hated me.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,23,7 The man who touches them must use an iron tool or the shaft of a spear. They must be burned up where they lie.'” 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,23,8 These are the names of David's mighty men Jeshbaal the Hachmonite was the leader of the mighty men. He killed eight hundred men on one occasion. * *
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,23,"9 After him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men. He was with David when they taunted the Philistines who had gathered together to do battle, and when the men of Israel had retreated. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,24,"1 Again the anger of Yahweh was ignited against Israel, and he moved David against them saying, “Go, count Israel and Judah.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,24,"2 The king said to Joab the commander of the army, who was with him, “Go throughout all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and count all the people, so that I may know the total number of men fit for battle.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,24,"3 Joab said to the king, “May Yahweh your God multiply the number of people a hundred times, and may the eyes of my master the king see it take place. But why does my master the king want this?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,24,"4 Nevertheless, the king's word was final against Joab and against the commanders of the army. So Joab and the commanders went out from the king's presence to count the people of Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,24,"5 They crossed over the Jordan and encamped near Aroer, south of the city in the valley. Then they traveled on through Gad to Jazer. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,24,"10 Then David's heart afflicted him after he had counted the men. So he said to Yahweh, “I have greatly sinned by doing this. Now, Yahweh, take away your servant's guilt, for I have acted very foolishly.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,24,"11 When David rose up in the morning, the word of Yahweh came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,24,12 “Go say to David 'This is what Yahweh says “I am giving you three choices. Choose one of them.”'” 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,24,"13 So Gad went to David and said to him, “Will three years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months from your enemies while they pursue you? Or will there be three days of plague in your land? Now decide what answer I should return to him who sent me.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,24,"14 Then David said to Gad, “I am in deep trouble. Let us fall into Yahweh's hands rather than into the hand of man, for his merciful actions are very great.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,24,"15 So Yahweh sent a plague on Israel from the morning to a fixed time, and seventy thousand people died from Dan to Beersheba. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,24,"16 When the angel reached out with his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Yahweh changed his mind because of the harm it would cause, and he said to the angel who was destroying people, “Enough! Now draw back your hand.” At that time the angel of Yahweh was standing at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,24,"17 Then David spoke to Yahweh when he saw the angel who had attacked the people, and said, “I have sinned, and I have acted perversely. But these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand punish me and my father's family!” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,24,"18 Then Gad came that day to David and said to him, “Go up and build an altar for Yahweh at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,24,"19 So David went up as Gad instructed him to do, as Yahweh had commanded. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,24,20 Araunah looked out and saw the king and his servants approaching. So Araunah went out and bowed to the king with his face to the ground. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,24,"21 Then Araunah said, “Why has my master the king come to me, his servant?” David replied, “To buy your threshing floor, so I can build an altar for Yahweh, so that the plague may be removed from the people.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,24,"22 Araunah said to David, “Take it as your own, my master the king. Do with it what is good in your sight. Look, here are oxen for the burnt offering and threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,24,"23 All this, my king, I, Araunah, will give to you.” Then he said to the king, “May Yahweh your God accept you.”"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,24,"24 The king said to Araunah, “No, I insist on buying it at a price. I will not offer as a burnt offering to Yahweh anything that costs me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Samuel,24,"25 David built an altar for Yahweh there and offered on it burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. So Yahweh answered the prayer on behalf of the land, and the plague on Israel was confined."

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,1,"2 Yahweh is a jealous God and avenges; Yahweh avenges and is full of wrath; Yahweh takes vengeance on his adversaries, and he continues his anger for his enemies. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,1,"3 Yahweh is slow to anger and great in power; he will not allow the wicked to go unpunished. Yahweh makes his way in the whirlwind and the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,1,"4 He rebukes the sea and makes it dry; he dries up all the rivers. Bashan is weak, and Carmel also; the flowers of Lebanon are weak. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,1,"11 Someone arose among you, Nineveh, who planned evil against Yahweh, someone who promoted wickedness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,1,"12 This is what Yahweh says, “Even if they are at their full strength and full numbers, they will nevertheless be sheared; their people will be no more. But you, Judah Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,1,13 Now will I break that people's yoke from off you; I will break your chains.” 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,1,"14 Yahweh has given a command about you, Nineveh “There will be no more descendants bearing your name. I will cut off the carved figures and the cast metal figures from the houses of your gods. I will dig your graves, for you are contemptible.” "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,2,"3 The shields of his mighty men are red, and the soldiers are clothed in scarlet; the chariots flash with their metal on the day that they are made ready, and the cypress spears are waved in the air. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,2,"4 The chariots speed through the streets; they rush back and forth in the wide streets. They look like torches, and they run like lightning. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,2,5 The one who will dash you to pieces calls his officers; they stumble over each other in their march; they hurry to attack the city wall. The large shield is made ready to protect these attackers.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,2,"9 Take the silver plunder, take the gold plunder, for there is no end to it, to the splendor of all Nineveh's beautiful things. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,2,"10 Nineveh is empty and ruined. Everyone's heart melts, everyone's knees strike together, and anguish is in everyone; their faces are all pale. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,2,"11 Where now is the lions' den, the place where the young lion cubs were fed, the place where the lion and lioness walked, with the cubs, where they were afraid of nothing? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,2,"12 The lion tore his victims to pieces for his cubs; he strangled victims for his lionesses, and filled his cave with victims, his dens with torn carcasses. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,2,"13 “See, I am against you—this is the declaration of Yahweh of hosts. I will burn your chariots in the smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions. I will cut off your prey from your land, and the voices of your messengers will be heard no more.” 3 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,3,1 Woe to the city full of blood! It is all full of lies and stolen property; victims are always in her. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,3,"2 But now there is the noise of whips and the sound of rattling wheels, prancing horses, and bounding chariots. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,3,"3 There are attacking horsemen, flashing swords, glittering spears, heaps of corpses, great piles of bodies. There is no end to the bodies; their attackers stumble over them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,3,"4 This is happening because of the lustful actions of the beautiful prostitute, the expert in witchcraft, who sells nations through her prostitution, and peoples through her acts of witchcraft. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,3,"5 “See, I am against you—this is the declaration of Yahweh of hosts—I will raise up your skirt over your face and show your private parts to the nations, your shame to the kingdoms. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,3,6 I will throw disgusting filth on you and make you vile; I will make you someone that everyone will look at. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,3,"7 It will come about that everyone who looks at you will flee from you and say, 'Nineveh is destroyed; who will weep for her?'Where can I find anyone to comfort you?”"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,3,"8 Nineveh, are you better than Thebes, that was built on the Nile River, that had water around her, whose defense was the ocean, whose wall was the sea itself? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,3,"9 Cush and Egypt were her strength, and there was no end to it; Put and Libya were allies to her. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,3,"10 Yet Thebes was carried away; she went into captivity; her young children were dashed in pieces at the head of every street; her enemies threw lots for her honorable men, and all her great men were bound in chains. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,3,"11 You also will become drunk; you will try to hide, and you will also look for a refuge from your enemy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,3,"12 All your fortresses will be like fig trees with the earliest ripe figs if they are shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,3,"13 See, the people among you are women; the gates of your land have been opened wide to your enemies; fire has devoured their bars. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,3,14 Go draw water for the siege; strengthen your fortresses; go into the clay and tread the mortar; pick up the molds for the bricks. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,3,"15 Fire will devour you there, and the sword will destroy you. It will devour you as young locusts devour everything. Make yourselves as many as the young locusts, as many as the full-grown locusts. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,3,16 You have multiplied your merchants more than the stars in the heavens; but they are like young locusts they plunder the land and then fly away. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,3,"17 Your princes are as many as the full-grown locusts, and your generals are like swarms of them that camp in the walls on a cold day. But when the sun rises they fly away to no one knows where. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,3,"18 King of Assyria, your shepherds are asleep; your rulers are lying down resting. Your people are scattered on the mountains, and there is no one to gather them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Nahum,3,19 No healing is possible for your wounds. Your wounds are severe. Everyone who hears the news about you will clap their hands in joy over you. Who has escaped your constant wickedness?

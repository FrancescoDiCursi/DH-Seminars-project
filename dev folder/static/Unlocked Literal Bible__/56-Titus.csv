Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus, Titus,
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,1,"1 Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of God's chosen people and the knowledge of the truth that agrees with godliness, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,1,"2 with the certain hope of everlasting life that God, who does not lie, promised before all the ages of time. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,1,"3 At the right time, he revealed his word by the message that he trusted me to deliver. I was to do this by the command of God our savior. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,1,"4 To Titus, a true son in our common faith. Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our savior. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,1,"5 For this purpose I left you in Crete, that you might set in order things not yet complete and ordain elders in every city as I directed you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,1,"6 An elder must be without blame, the husband of one wife, with faithful children who do not have the reputation of being reckless or undisciplined. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,1,"7 It is necessary for the overseer, as God's household manager, to be blameless. He must not be arrogant, not be easily angered, not addicted to wine, not a brawler, and not a greedy man. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,1,"8 Instead, he should be hospitable and a friend of what is good. He must be sensible, righteous, godly, and self-controlled. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,1,"9 He should hold tightly to the trustworthy message that was taught, so that he may be able to encourage others with good teaching and correct those who oppose him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,1,"10 For there are many rebellious people, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,1,11 It is necessary to stop them. They are upsetting whole families by teaching for shameful profit what they should not teach. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,1,"12 One of their own prophets has said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,1,"13 This statement is true. Therefore, correct them severely, so that they may be sound in the faith, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,1,14 not paying any attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of people who turn away from the truth. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,1,"15 To those who are pure, all things are pure. But to those who are corrupt and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their minds and their consciences have been corrupted. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,1,"16 They profess to know God, but they deny him by their actions. They are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for doing any good work. 2 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,2,"1 But you, speak what fits with faithful instruction. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,2,"2 Teach older men to be temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in faith, in love, and in perseverance. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,2,"3 Teach older women likewise to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers or being slaves to much wine, but to be teachers of what is good. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,2,"4 In this way they may train the younger women to love their own husbands and children, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,2,"5 to be sensible, pure, good housekeepers, and obedient to their own husbands. They should do these things so that God's word may not be insulted. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,2,"6 In the same way, encourage the younger men to use good sense. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,2,"7 In all ways present yourself as an example of good works. In your teaching, show integrity, dignity, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,2,"8 and a correct message, so that anyone who opposes you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,2,"9 Teach slaves to obey their masters in everything, to please them and not argue with them, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,2,"10 to not steal from them, but instead to demonstrate all good faith, so that in every way they may bring credit to the teaching about God our Savior. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,2,11 For the grace of God has appeared for the salvation of all people. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,2,"12 It trains us to reject godlessness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in this age, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,2,"13 while we look forward to receiving our blessed hope, the appearance of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,2,"14 Jesus gave himself for us in order to redeem us from all lawlessness and to make pure, for himself, a special people who are eager to do good works. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,2,"15 Speak of these things, encourage people to do them, and give correction with all authority. Let no one disregard you. 3 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,3,"1 Remind them to submit to rulers and authorities, to obey them, to be ready for every good work, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,3,"2 to revile no one, to not be eager to fight, and to be gentle, showing all humility toward everyone. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,3,3 For once we ourselves were thoughtless and disobedient. We were led astray and enslaved by various passions and pleasures. We lived in evil and envy. We were detestable and hated one another. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,3,"4 But when the kindness of God our savior and his love for mankind appeared, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,3,"5 it was not by works of righteousness that we did, but by his mercy that he saved us. He saved us through the washing of new birth and renewal by the Holy Spirit. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,3,"6 God richly poured the Holy Spirit on us through our Savior Jesus Christ, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,3,"7 so that having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs with the certain hope of eternal life. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,3,"8 This message is trustworthy. I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to engage themselves in good works. These things are good and useful for everyone. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,3,9 But avoid foolish debates and genealogies and strife and conflict about the law. Those things are unprofitable and worthless. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,3,"10 Reject anyone who is causing divisions among you, after one or two warnings, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,3,11 knowing that such a person has turned from the right way and is sinning and condemns himself. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,3,"12 When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, hurry and come to me at Nicopolis, where I have decided to spend the winter. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,3,"13 Do everything you can to send on their way Zenas the lawyer and Apollos, so that they lack nothing. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,3,"14 Our people must learn to engage themselves in good works that provide for urgent needs, and so not be unfruitful. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Titus,3,15 All those who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with all of you.

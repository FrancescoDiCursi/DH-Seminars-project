Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs, Proverbs,
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,"1 The proverbs of Solomon son of David, the king of Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,"2 These proverbs are to teach wisdom and instruction, to teach words of insight, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,"3 that you may receive instruction in order to live by doing what is right, just, and fair. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,"4 These proverbs are also to give wisdom to the naive, and to give knowledge and discretion to young people. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,"5 Let wise people listen and increase their learning, and let discerning people get guidance, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,"6 to understand proverbs, sayings, and words of wise people and their riddles. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,7 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge— fools despise wisdom and instruction. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,"8 My son, hear the instruction of your father and do not lay aside the rules of your mother; "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,9 they will be a graceful wreath for your head and pendants hanging from your neck. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,"10 My son, if sinners try to entice you into their sin, refuse to follow them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,"11 If they say, “Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us hide and attack innocent people for no reason. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,"12 Let us swallow them up alive, like Sheol takes away those who are healthy, and make them like those who fall into the pit. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,13 We shall find all kinds of valuable things; we will fill our houses with what we steal from others. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,14 Throw in your lot with us; we will all have one purse together.” 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,"15 My son, do not walk down that road with them; do not let your foot touch where they walk; "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,16 their feet run to evil and they hurry to shed blood. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,17 For it is useless to spread the net in the sight of any bird. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,18 These men lie in wait for their own blood— they set an ambush for their own lives. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,19 So are the ways of everyone who gains riches by injustice; unjust gain takes away the lives of those who hold on to it. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,"20 Wisdom cries aloud in the street, she raises her voice in the open places; "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,"21 at the head of the noisy streets she cries out, at the entrance of the city gates she speaks, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,"22 “How long, you naive people, will you love being naive? How long, you mockers, will you delight in mockery, and how long, you fools, will you hate knowledge? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,23 Pay attention to my correction; I will pour out my thoughts to you; I will make my words known to you. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,"24 I have called, and you have refused to listen; I reached out with my hand, but there was no one who paid attention."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,25 But you have ignored all my instruction and paid no attention to my correction. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,"26 I will laugh at your calamity, I will mock you when the terror comes— "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,"27 when your fearful dread comes like a storm and disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,"28 Then they will call upon me, and I will not answer; they will desperately call for me, but they will not find me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,"29 Because they hate knowledge and did not choose the fear of Yahweh, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,"30 they would not follow my instruction, and they despised all my correction. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,"31 They will eat the fruit of their ways, and with the fruit of their schemes they will be filled. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,"32 For the naive are killed when they turn away, and the indifference of fools will destroy them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,1,33 But whoever listens to me will live in safety and will rest secure with no fear of disaster.” 2 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,2,"1 My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,2,2 make your ears pay attention to wisdom and incline your heart to understanding. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,2,"3 If you cry out for understanding and raise your voice for it, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,2,"4 if you seek it like you would seek silver and search for understanding as you would seek hidden treasures, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,2,5 then you will understand the fear of Yahweh and you will find the knowledge of God. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,2,"6 For Yahweh gives wisdom, from his mouth comes knowledge and understanding. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,2,"7 He stores up sound wisdom for those who please him, he is a shield for those who walk in integrity, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,2,8 he guards the paths of justice and he will preserve the way of those who are faithful to him. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,2,"9 Then you will understand righteousness, justice, and equity, and every good path. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,2,"10 For wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,2,"11 Discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,2,"12 They will rescue you from the way of evil, from those who speak perverse things, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,2,13 who abandon the right paths and walk in the ways of darkness. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,2,14 They rejoice when they do evil and delight in the perversities of evil. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,2,"15 They follow crooked paths, and using deception they hide their tracks."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,2,"16 Wisdom and discretion will save you from an adulterous woman, from an immoral woman and her flattering words. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,2,17 She forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,2,18 For her house leads down to death and her tracks will lead you to those in the grave. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,2,19 All who go in to her will not return again and they will not find the paths of life. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,2,20 So you will walk in the way of good people and follow the paths of righteous people. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,2,"21 For those doing right will make a home in the land, and those with integrity will remain in it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,2,"22 But the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the faithless will be cut off from it. 3 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,"1 My son, do not forget my commands and keep my teachings in your heart, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,2 for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,"3 Do not let covenant faithfulness and trustworthiness ever leave you, tie them together about your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,4 Then you will find favor and a good reputation in the sight of God and man. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,5 Trust in Yahweh with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding; 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,6 in all your ways acknowledge him and he will make your paths straight. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,7 Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear Yahweh and turn away from evil. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,8 It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment for your body. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,"9 Honor Yahweh with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,"10 and your storehouses will be filled up and your vats will be bursting, full of new wine. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,"11 My son, do not despise Yahweh's instruction and do not hate his rebuke, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,"12 for Yahweh disciplines those he loves, as a father deals with a son who pleases him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,13 The one who finds wisdom is blessed; he also gets understanding. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,14 What you gain from wisdom is better than what silver will give in return and its profit is better than gold. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,15 Wisdom is more precious than jewels and nothing you desire can compare to her. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,16 She has length of days in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,17 Her ways are ways of kindness and all her paths are peace.
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,"18 She is a tree of life to those who take hold of it, those who hold on to it are happy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,"19 By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth, by understanding he established the heavens. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,20 By his knowledge the depths broke open and the clouds dropped their dew. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,"21 My son, keep sound judgment and discernment, and do not lose sight of them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,22 They will be life to your soul and an adornment of favor to wear around your neck. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,23 Then you will walk on your way in safety and your foot will not stumble; 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,"24 when you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,"25 Do not be afraid of sudden terror or devastation caused by the wicked, when it comes, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,26 for Yahweh will be on your side and will keep your foot from being caught in a trap. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,"27 Do not withhold good from those who deserve it, when it is in your power to act. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,"28 Do not say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give it,” when you have the money with you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,29 Do not make a plan to harm your neighbor— the one who lives close and trusts you. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,"30 Do not argue with a person without a reason, when he has done nothing to harm you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,31 Do not envy a violent person or choose any of his ways. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,"32 For the devious person is detestable to Yahweh, but he brings the upright person into his confidence. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,"33 The curse of Yahweh is on the house of the wicked person, but he blesses the home of righteous people. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,"34 He mocks mockers, but he gives his favor to humble people. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,3,"35 Wise people inherit honor, but fools will be lifted up in their shame. 4 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,"1 Listen, sons, to a father's instruction, and pay attention so you will know what understanding is. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,2 I am giving you good instructions; do not forsake my teaching. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,"3 When I was a son of my father, the tender and only child of my mother, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,"4 he taught me and said to me, “Let your heart hold fast to my words; keep my commands and live. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,5 Acquire wisdom and understanding; do not forget and do not reject the words of my mouth;
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,6 do not abandon wisdom and she will watch over you; love her and she will keep you safe. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,"7 Wisdom is the most important thing, so acquire wisdom and spend all you own so you can get understanding. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,8 Cherish wisdom and she will exalt you; she will honor you when you embrace her. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,9 She will put a wreath of honor on your head; she will give you a beautiful crown.” 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,"10 Listen, my son, and pay attention to my words, and you will have many years in your life. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,11 I direct you in the way of wisdom; I lead you down straight paths. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,"12 When you walk, no one will stand in your way and if you run, you will not stumble. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,"13 Hold on to instruction, do not let it go; guard it, for it is your life. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,14 Do not follow the path of the wicked and do not go along the way of those who do evil. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,"15 Avoid it, do not go on it; turn away from it and go another way. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,16 For they cannot sleep until they do evil and they are robbed of sleep until they cause someone to stumble. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,17 For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,18 But the path of righteous people is like the first light that grows brighter; it shines more and more until the fullness of the day comes. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,19 The way of the wicked is like darkness— they do not know what it is they stumble over. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,"20 My son, pay attention to my words; incline your ear to my sayings. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,21 Do not let them turn away from your eyes; keep them in your heart. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,22 For my words are life to those who find them and health to their whole body. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,"23 Keep your heart safe and guard it with all diligence, for from it flow the springs of life. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,24 Put crooked speech away from you and put corrupt talk far from you. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,25 Let your eyes look straight ahead and fix your gaze straight before you. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,26 Make a level path for your foot; then all your ways will be secure. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,4,27 Do not turn aside to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil. 5 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,"1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom; incline your ears to my understanding, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,2 so you may learn about discretion and your lips may protect knowledge. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,"3 For the lips of an adulteress drip with honey and her mouth is smoother than oil,"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,"4 but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood, cutting like a sharp sword. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,5 Her feet go down to death; her steps go all the way to Sheol. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,6 She gives no thought to the path of life. Her footsteps wander; she does not know where she is going. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,"7 Now, my sons, listen to me; do not turn away from listening to the words of my mouth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,8 Keep your path far away from her and do not come near the door of her house. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,9 In that way you will not give away your honor to others or years of your life to a cruel person; 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,10 strangers will not feast on your wealth; what you have worked for will not go into the house of strangers. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,11 At the end of your life you will groan when your flesh and your body waste away. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,"12 You will say, “How I hated instruction and my heart despised correction! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,13 I would not obey my teachers or incline my ear to my instructors. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,"14 I was almost completely ruined in the midst of the assembly, among the gathering of the people.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,15 Drink water from your own cistern and drink running water from your own well. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,16 Should your springs overflow everywhere and your streams of water flow in the public squares? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,17 Let them be for yourself alone and not for strangers with you. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,"18 May your fountain be blessed and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,19 for she is a loving deer and a graceful doe. Let her breasts satisfy you at all times; may you be continually intoxicated by her love. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,"20 For why should you, my son, be captivated by an adulteress; why should you embrace the breasts of an immoral woman? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,21 Yahweh sees everything a person does and watches all the paths he takes. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,22 A wicked person will be seized by his own iniquities; the cords of his sin will hold him tight. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,5,23 He will die because he lacks instruction; he is led astray by his great foolishness. 6 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,"1 My son, if you set aside your money as a guarantee for your neighbor's loan, if you gave your promise for a loan of someone you do not know, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,2 then you have laid a trap for yourself by your promise and you have been caught by the words of your mouth. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,"3 When you are caught by your words, my son, do this and save yourself, since you have fallen into the hand of your neighbor; go and humble yourself and make your case before your neighbor."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,4 Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,"5 Save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the hand of the fowler. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,"6 Look at the ant, you lazy person, consider her ways, and be wise. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,"7 It has no commander, officer, or ruler, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,8 yet it prepares its food in the summer and during the harvest it stores up what it will eat. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,"9 How long will you sleep, you lazy person? When will you rise from your sleep? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,"10 “A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest”— "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,11 and your poverty will come like a robber and your needs like an armed soldier. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,"12 A worthless person—a wicked man— lives by the crookedness of his speech, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,"13 winking his eyes, making signals with his feet and pointing with his fingers. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,14 He plots evil with deceit in his heart; he always stirs up discord. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,15 Therefore his disaster will overtake him in an instant; in a moment he will be broken beyond healing. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,"16 There are six things that Yahweh hates, seven that are disgusting to him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,"17 The eyes of a proud person, a tongue that lies, hands that shed the blood of innocent people, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,"18 a heart that invents wicked schemes, feet that quickly run to do evil, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,19 a witness who breathes out lies and one who sows discord among brothers. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,"20 My son, obey the command of your father and do not forsake the teaching of your mother. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,21 Always bind them on your heart; tie them about your neck. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,"22 When you walk, they will guide you; when you sleep, they will watch over you; and when you wake up, they will teach you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,"23 For the commands are a lamp, and the teaching is a light; the corrections that come by instruction are the way of life. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,"24 It keeps you from the immoral woman, from the smooth words of an immoral woman. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,25 Do not lust in your heart after her beauty and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,"26 Sleeping with a prostitute can cost the price of a loaf of bread, but the wife of another may cost you your very life. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,27 Can a man carry a fire against his chest without burning his clothes? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,28 Can a man walk on hot coals without scorching his feet? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,29 So is the man who sleeps with his neighbor's wife; the one who sleeps with her will not go unpunished.
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,30 People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his need when he is hungry. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,"31 Yet if he is caught, he will pay back seven times what he stole; he must give up everything of value in his house. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,32 The one who commits adultery has no sense; the one who does it destroys himself. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,33 Wounds and shame are what he deserves and his disgrace will not be wiped away. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,34 For jealousy makes a man furious; he will show no mercy when he takes his revenge. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,6,"35 He will accept no compensation and he cannot be bought off, though you offer him many gifts. 7 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,"1 My son, keep my words and store up my commands within yourself. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,2 Keep my commands and live and keep my instruction as the apple of your eye. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,3 Tie them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,"4 Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” and call understanding your kinsman, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,"5 in order to keep yourself from the adulterous woman, from the immoral woman with her smooth words. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,6 At the window of my house I was looking out through the lattice. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,"7 I looked at the naive people, and I noticed among the young men a youth who had no sense. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,"8 That young man passed down the street near her corner, and he went toward her house. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,"9 It was twilight, in the evening of the day, at the time of night and darkness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,"10 There a woman met him, dressed like a prostitute, with a false heart. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,11 She was loud and wayward; her feet did not stay at home. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,"12 Now in the streets, then in the market place, and at every corner she waited in ambush. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,"13 So she grabbed him and kissed him, with a strong face she said to him, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,"14 “I made my peace offering today, I paid my vows, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,"15 so came I out to meet you, to eagerly seek your face, and I have found you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,"16 I have spread coverings on my bed, colored linens from Egypt. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,"17 I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,"18 Come, let us drink our fill of love until morning; let us take great pleasure in acts of love."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,19 For my husband is not at his house; he has gone on a long journey. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,20 He took a bag of money with him; he will return on the day of the full moon.” 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,21 With much talk she turned him; with her smooth lips she misled him. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,"22 He went after her suddenly like an ox going to slaughter, like a deer caught in a trap, * "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,23 until an arrow pierces through its liver. He was like a bird rushing into a snare. He did not know that it would cost his life. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,"24 Now, my sons, listen to me; pay attention to the words of my mouth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,25 May your heart not turn aside onto her paths; do not be led astray onto her paths. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,26 She has caused many people to fall down pierced; her dead victims are very many. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,7,27 Her house is on the paths to Sheol; they go down to the dark bedrooms of death. 8 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,1 Does not Wisdom call out? Does not Understanding raise her voice? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"2 On the hilltops beside the road, at the crossroads, Wisdom has taken her stand. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"3 Before the gates at the entrance into the city, at the entrances into the city, she calls out. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"4 “It is to you, people, that I call; my voice is for the sons of mankind. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"5 You who are naive, learn wisdom; and you who are foolish, you must get an understanding mind. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"6 Listen, because I will speak of noble things, and when my lips open I will say upright things. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"7 For my mouth speaks what is trustworthy, and wickedness is disgusting to my lips. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,8 All the words of my mouth are just; in them is nothing twisted or misleading. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,9 All of them are straight for the person who understands; my words are upright for those who find knowledge. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,10 Acquire my instruction rather than silver; acquire knowledge rather than pure gold. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,11 For Wisdom is better than jewels; no treasure is equal to her. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"12 I, Wisdom, live with Prudence, and I possess knowledge and discretion. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"13 The fear of Yahweh is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance, the evil way, and perverted speech. I hate them. *"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,14 I have good advice and sound wisdom; I am insight; strength belongs to me. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"15 By me kings reign, and rulers make laws that are just. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"16 By me princes rule, nobles, and all who govern with justice. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"17 I love those who love me, and those who diligently seek me, find me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"18 With me are riches and honor, lasting wealth and righteousness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; my produce is better than pure silver. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"20 I walk in the path of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"21 As a result, I make those who love me inherit wealth; I fill up their treasuries. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"22 Yahweh created me at the beginning, the first of his deeds then. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"23 In ages long ago I was made—from the first, from the beginnings of the earth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"24 Before there were oceans, I was given birth— before there were springs abounding with water. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"25 Before the mountains were settled and before the hills, I was born. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"26 I was born before Yahweh had made the earth or the fields, or even the first dust in the world. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"27 I was there when he established the heavens, when he drew a circle on the surface of the deep. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,28 I was there when he established the clouds above and when the springs in the deep became fixed. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"29 I was there when he made his limit for the sea, so the waters should not spread beyond his command, and when there was set the limit for the foundations of the dry land. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"30 I was beside him, as a skilled craftsman; I was his delight day after day, always rejoicing before him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"31 I was rejoicing in his whole world, and my delight was in the sons of mankind. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"32 Now, my sons, listen to me, for those who keep my ways will be blessed. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,33 Listen to my instruction and be wise; do not neglect it. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"34 The one who listens to me will be blessed. He will be watching every day at my doors, waiting beside the posts of my doors. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"35 For whoever finds me, finds life, and he will find the favor of Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,8,"36 But he who fails, harms his own life; all who hate me love death.” 9 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,9,1 Wisdom has built her own house; she has carved seven pillars out of rocks. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,9,2 She has slaughtered her animals; she has mixed her wine; and she has set her table.
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,9,"3 She has sent out her maids; she calls out from the highest points of the city, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,9,4 “Who is naive? Let him turn aside here!” To the one lacking good sense she speaks. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,9,"5 “Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,9,6 Leave your naive actions and live; walk in the path of understanding. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,9,"7 Whoever disciplines a mocker receives abuse, and whoever rebukes a wicked person receives insults. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,9,"8 Do not reprove a mocker, or he will hate you; reprove a wise man, and he will love you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,9,"9 Give to a wise person, and he will become even wiser; teach a righteous person, and he will add to his learning. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,9,"10 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,9,"11 For through me your days will be multiplied, and years of life will be added to you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,9,"12 If you are wise, you are wise for yourself, and if you mock, you will carry it by yourself.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,9,13 The woman of foolishness is ignorant; she is untaught and knows nothing. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,9,"14 She sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the highest places of the town. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,9,"15 She is calling out to those who pass by in the streets, to people walking straight on their way. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,9,"16 “Let anyone who is naive turn aside here,” she says to those who have no sense. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,9,"17 “Stolen waters are sweet, and bread of secrecy is delicious.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,9,"18 But he does not know that the dead are there, that her invited guests are in the depths of Sheol. 10 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,10,1 The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son makes his father rejoice but a foolish son brings grief to his mother. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Proverbs,10,"2 Treasures accumulated by wickedness have no value, but doing what is right keeps you from death. "

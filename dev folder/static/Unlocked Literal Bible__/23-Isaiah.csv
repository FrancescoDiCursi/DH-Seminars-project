Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah, Isaiah,
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"1 The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz, that he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"2 Hear, heavens, and give ear, earth; for Yahweh has spoken “I have nourished and brought up children, but they have rebelled against me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"3 The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master's feeding trough, but Israel does not know, Israel does not understand.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"4 Woe! Nation, sinners, a people weighed down with iniquity, offspring of evildoers, sons who act corruptly! They have abandoned Yahweh, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they have estranged themselves from him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"5 Why are you still being beaten? Why do you rebel more and more? The whole head is sick, the whole heart is weak. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"6 From the sole of the foot to the head there is no part unharmed; only wounds, and bruises, and fresh open wounds; they have not been closed, cleansed, bandaged, nor treated with oil. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"7 Your country is ruined; your cities are burned; your fields—in your presence, strangers are destroying them— abandoned devastation, overthrown by strangers. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"8 The daughter of Zion is left like a hut in a vineyard, like a shed in a garden of cucumbers, like a besieged city. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"9 If Yahweh of hosts had not left for us a small remnant, we would have been like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"10 Hear the word of Yahweh, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"11 “What is the multitude of your sacrifices to me?” says Yahweh. “I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fatted beasts; and in the blood of bulls, lambs, or goats I do not delight. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"12 When you come to appear before me, who has required this of you, to trample my courts? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,13 Bring no more meaningless offerings; incense is an abomination to me; your new moon and Sabbath assemblies —I cannot tolerate these wicked assemblies. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,14 I hate your new moons and your appointed feasts; they are a burden to me; I am tired of enduring them. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"15 So when you spread out your hands in prayer, I hide my eyes from you; even though you offer many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"16 Wash, cleanse yourselves; remove the evil of your deeds from my sight; stop being evil; "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"17 learn to do good; seek justice, make straight the oppression, * give justice to the fatherless, defend the widow.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"18 “Come now, and let us reason together,” says Yahweh; “though your sins are like scarlet, they will be white like snow; though they are red like crimson, they will be like wool. *"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"19 If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the good of the land, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"20 but if you refuse and rebel, the sword will devour you,” for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"21 How the faithful city has become a prostitute! She who was full of justice—she was full of righteousness, but now she is full of murderers. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"22 Your silver has become impure, your wine mixed with water. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"23 Your princes are rebels and companions of thieves; everyone loves bribes and runs after payoffs. They do not defend the fatherless, nor does the widow's legal plea come before them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"24 Therefore this is the declaration of the Lord Yahweh of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel “Woe to them! I will take vengeance against my adversaries, and avenge myself against my enemies; "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"25 I will turn my hand against you, refine away your dross as with lye, and take away all your dross. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"26 I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning; after that you will be called the city of righteousness, a faithful town.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"27 Zion will be redeemed by justice, and her repentant ones by righteousness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"28 Rebels and sinners will be crushed together, and those who abandon Yahweh will be done away with. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"29 “For you will be ashamed of the sacred oak trees that you desired, and you will be embarrassed by the gardens that you have chosen. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"30 For you will be like an oak whose leaf fades, and like a garden that has no water. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,1,"31 The strong man will be like tinder, and his work like a spark; they will both burn together, and no one will quench them.” 2 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,2,"1 The things that Isaiah son of Amoz perceived in a vision, concerning Judah and Jerusalem. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,2,"2 It will be in the last days that the mountain of Yahweh's house will be established as the highest of the mountains, and it will be raised up above the hills, and all the nations will flow to it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,2,"3 Many peoples will come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh, to the house of the God of Jacob, so he may teach us some of his ways, and we may walk in his paths.” For out of Zion will go the law, and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,2,"4 He will judge between the nations and will render decisions for many peoples; they will hammer their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation will not lift up sword against nation, nor will they train for war any longer. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,2,"5 House of Jacob, come, and let us walk in the light of Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,2,"6 For you have abandoned your people, the house of Jacob, because they are filled with customs from the east and they practice divination like the Philistines, and they shake hands with sons of foreigners. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,2,"7 Their land is full of silver and gold, and is there no limit to their wealth; their land also is full of horses, nor is there limit to their chariots."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,2,"8 Their land also is full of idols; they worship the craftsmanship of their own hands, things that their own fingers have made. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,2,"9 The people will be bowed down, and individuals will fall down; therefore do not raise them up. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,2,10 Go into the rocky places and hide in the ground from the terror of Yahweh and from the glory of his majesty. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,2,"11 The lofty gaze of man will be brought low, and the pride of men will be brought down, and Yahweh alone will be exalted on that day. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,2,"12 For there will be a day of Yahweh of hosts against everyone who is proud and raised up, and against everyone who is arrogant—and he will be brought down— "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,2,"13 and against all the cedars of Lebanon that are high and lifted up, and against all the oaks of Bashan. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,2,"14 That day of Yahweh of hosts will be against all the high mountains, and against all the hills that are lifted up, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,2,"15 and against every high tower, and against every impregnable wall, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,2,"16 and against all the ships of Tarshish, and against all beautiful sailing vessels. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,2,"17 The pride of man will be brought low, and the haughtiness of men will fall; Yahweh alone will be exalted on that day. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,2,18 The idols will completely pass away. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,2,"19 Men will go into the caves of the rocks and the holes of the ground, from the terror of Yahweh, and from the glory of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,2,20 On that day people will throw away their idols of silver and of gold that they have made for themselves to worship—they will throw them away to the moles and bats. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,2,"21 The people will go into the crevices in the rocks and into the clefts of the ragged rocks, from the terror of Yahweh and from the glory of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,2,"22 Stop trusting in man, whose life-breath is in his nostrils, for what does he amount to? 3 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,"1 See, the Lord Yahweh of hosts is about to take away from Jerusalem and from Judah support and staff the whole supply of bread and the whole supply of water, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,"2 the mighty man and the warrior, the judge and the prophet, the one who practices divination and the elder, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,"3 the captain of fifty and the respected citizen, the counselor, the expert craftsman and the skillful enchanter. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,"4 “I will place mere youths as their leaders, and the young will rule over them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,"5 The people will be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbor; the child will insult the elderly, and the degraded will challenge the honorable. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,"6 A man will even take hold of his brother in his father's house and say, 'You have a coat; be our ruler, and let this ruin be in your hands.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,"7 On that day he will shout and say, 'I will not be a healer; I have no bread or clothing. You will not make me ruler of the people.'”"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,"8 For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen, because their speech and their actions are against Yahweh, defying the eyes of his glory. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,9 The look on their faces witnesses against them; and they tell of their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to them! For they have completed a catastrophe for themselves. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,"10 Tell the righteous person that it will be well, for they will eat the fruit of their deeds. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,"11 Woe to the wicked! It will go badly for him, for the recompense of his hands will be done to him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,"12 My people—children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. My people, those who guide you lead you astray and confuse the direction of your path. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,13 Yahweh stands up for an accusation; he is standing to accuse the people. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,14 Yahweh will come with judgment against the elders of his people and their leaders “You have ruined the vineyard; the plunder from the poor is in your houses. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,15 Why do you crush my people and grind the faces of the poor?” This is the declaration of the Lord Yahweh of hosts. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,"16 Yahweh says that because the daughters of Zion are proud, they walk with their necks extended, with flirting eyes, walking with tiny steps as they go, making tinkling sounds from bracelets on their ankles. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,"17 Therefore the Lord will form scabs on the heads of the daughters of Zion, and Yahweh will make them bald. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,"18 On that day the Lord will remove their beautiful ankle jewelry, head bands, the crescent ornaments, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,"19 the ear pendants, the bracelets, and the veils; "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,"20 the headscarves, the ankle chains, the sashes, and the perfume boxes, and the lucky charms. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,21 He will remove the rings and the nose jewels; 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,"22 the festive robes, the mantles, the veils, and the handbags; "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,"23 the hand mirrors, the fine linen, the head pieces, and the wraps. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,"24 Instead of sweet perfume there will be stench; and instead of a sash, a rope; instead of well-arranged hair, baldness; and instead of a robe, a covering of sackcloth; and branding instead of beauty. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,"25 Your men will fall by the sword, and your strong men will fall in war. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,3,26 Jerusalem's gates will lament and mourn; and she will be alone and sit upon the ground. 4 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,4,"1 On that day seven women will take hold of one man and say, “Our own food we will eat, our own clothing we will wear. But let us take your name to remove our shame.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,4,"2 On that day the branch of Yahweh will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be tasty and delightful for those survivors in Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,4,"3 It will happen that the one who is left in Zion and the one who remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone who is written down as living in Jerusalem."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,4,"4 This will happen when the Lord will have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and will have cleansed the blood stains from Jerusalem's midst, by means of the spirit of judgment and the spirit of flaming fire. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,4,"5 Then over the whole site of Mount Zion and over her place of assembly, Yahweh will create cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; it will be a canopy over all the glory. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,4,"6 It will be a shelter for shade in the daytime from the heat, and a refuge and a cover from the storm and rain. 5 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"1 Let me sing for my well beloved, a song of my beloved about his vineyard. My well beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"2 He spaded it, removed the stones, and planted it with an excellent kind of vine. He built a tower in the middle of it, and also built a winepress. He waited for it to produce grapes, but it only produced wild grapes. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"3 So now, inhabitant of Jerusalem and man of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"4 What more could have been done for my vineyard, that I have not done for it? When I looked for it to produce grapes, why did it produce wild grapes? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"5 Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard I will remove the hedge, I will turn it into a pasture, I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled down. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"6 I will lay it waste, and it will not be pruned nor hoed. Instead, briers and thorns will spring up. I will also command the clouds not to rain on it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"7 For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts is the house of Israel, and the man of Judah his pleasant planting; he waited for justice, but instead, there was killing; for righteousness, but, instead, a shout for help. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"8 Woe to those who join house to house, who join field to field, until no room remains, and you alone remain in the land! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"9 Yahweh of hosts told me, many houses will be empty, even great and impressive ones, without any inhabitant. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"10 For a ten-yoke vineyard will yield only one bath, and one homer of seed will yield only an ephah. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"11 Woe to those who rise up early in the morning to obtain strong drink, those who linger late into the night until wine inflames them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"12 They banquet with harp, lute, tambourine, flute, and wine, but they do not recognize the work of Yahweh, nor have they considered the doings of his hands. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"13 Therefore my people have gone into captivity for lack of understanding; their honored leaders go hungry, and their common people have nothing to drink. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"14 Therefore Sheol has made its appetite greater and has opened its mouth very wide; their elite, the people, their leaders, and the revelers and those who are happy among them, descend into Sheol. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"15 Man will be forced to bend down, and mankind will be humbled; the eyes of the lofty will be cast down."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"16 Yahweh of hosts will be exalted in his justice, and God the Holy One will show himself holy by his righteousness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"17 Then the sheep will feed as in their own pasture, and in the ruins, lambs will graze as foreigners. * "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,18 Woe to those who pull along iniquity with useless cords and who pull along sin as if it were with a cart rope. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"19 Woe to those who say, “Let God hurry, let him act quickly, so we can see it happen; and let the plans of the Holy One of Israel come, so that we may know them.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"20 Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; who represent darkness as light, and light as darkness; who represent bitter as sweet, and sweet as bitter! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"21 Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own understanding! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"22 Woe to those who are champions at drinking wine, and masters at mixing strong drinks; "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"23 who acquit the wicked for payment, and deprive the innocent of his rights! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"24 Therefore as the tongue of fire devours stubble, and as the dry grass goes down in flame, so their root will rot, and their blossom will blow away like dust. This will happen because they have rejected the law of Yahweh of hosts, and because they have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"25 Therefore the anger of Yahweh is kindled against his people. He has reached out with his hand against them and has punished them. The mountains tremble, and their corpses are like garbage in the streets. In all these things, his anger does not subside; instead, his hand is still stretched out. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"26 He will lift up a signal flag for far away nations and will whistle for those at the end of the earth. Look, they will come speedily and promptly. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"27 None tire or stumble among them; none slumbers or sleeps. Nor are their belts loose, or the thongs of their sandals broken. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"28 Their arrows are sharp and all their bows are bent; their horses' hooves are like flint, and their chariot wheels like storms. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"29 Their roaring will be like a lion; they will roar like young lions. They will growl and seize the prey and drag it away, with none to rescue. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,5,"30 On that day they will roar against the prey as the sea roars. If anyone looks over the land, he will see darkness and suffering; even the light will be made dark by the clouds. 6 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,6,"1 In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne; he was high and elevated, and the hem of his robe filled the temple. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,6,"2 Above him were the seraphim; each one had six wings; with two each covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,6,"3 Each one called to another and said, “Holy, holy, holy, is Yahweh of hosts! The whole earth is full of his glory.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,6,"4 The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voices of those who were crying out, and the house was filled with smoke. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,6,"5 Then I said, * “Woe is me! For I am doomed because I am a man of unclean lips,and I live among a people of unclean lips,because my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh, Yahweh of hosts!”"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,6,"6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me; he had a glowing coal in his hand, that he had taken with the tongs from off the altar. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,6,"7 He touched my mouth with it and said, “See, this has touched your lips; your guilt has been taken away, and your sin atoned for.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,6,"8 I heard the voice of the Lord say, “Whom shall I send; who will go for us?” Then I said, “Here I am; send me.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,6,"9 He said, “Go and tell this people, 'Listen, but do not understand; see, but do not perceive.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,6,"10 Make the heart of this people insensitive, and their ears dull, and blind their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and then turn and be healed.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,6,"11 Then I said, “Lord, how long?” He answered, “Until cities crash into ruins and are without inhabitants, and the houses are without people, and the land falls into a desolate waste, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,6,"12 and until Yahweh has sent the people far away, and the solitude of the land is great. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,6,"13 Even if a tenth of the people remain in it, it will again be destroyed; as a terebinth or an oak is cut down and whose trunk remains, the holy seed is in its stump.” 7 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,"1 During the days of Ahaz son of Jotham son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Aram, and Pekah son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but they could not prevail against it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,"2 It was reported to the house of David that Aram was allied with Ephraim. His heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest shake in the wind. * "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,"3 Then Yahweh said to Isaiah, “Go out with your son Shear-Jashub to meet Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the road to Launderer's Field. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,"4 Tell him, 'Be careful, remain calm, do not be afraid or intimidated by these two smoldering firebrands, by the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram, and of Pekah son of Remaliah. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,"5 Aram, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah have planned evil against you; they have said, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,"6 “Let us attack Judah and terrify her, and let us break into her and set up our king there, the son of Tabeel.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,"7 The Lord Yahweh says, “It will not take place; it will not happen, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,"8 because the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. Within sixty-five years, Ephraim will be shattered and will no longer be a people. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,"9 The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If you do not remain firm in faith, surely you will not remain secure.”'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,"10 The Lord spoke again to Ahaz, † "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,11 “Ask a sign of Yahweh your God; ask for it in the depths or in the height above.” 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,"12 But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, nor will I test Yahweh.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,"13 So Isaiah replied, “Listen, house of David. Is it not enough for you people to test the patience of people? Must you also test the patience of my God? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,"14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you people a sign See, the young woman will conceive, bear a son, and will call his name Immanuel. ‡ "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,15 He * will eat curds and honey when he knows to refuse the evil and choose the good.
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,"16 For before the child knows to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you dread will be desolate. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,"17 Yahweh will bring on you, on your people, and on your father's house days unlike any since Ephraim seceded from Judah—he will bring on you the king of Assyria.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,"18 At that time Yahweh will whistle for a fly from the distant streams of Egypt, and for a bee from the land of Assyria. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,"19 They will all come and settle down into all the gorges, into the clefts of the rocks, on all the thornbushes, and onto all the pastures. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,20 At that time the Lord will shave with a razor that was hired beyond the Euphrates River—the king of Assyria— the head and the hair of the legs; it will also sweep away the beard. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,"21 On that day, a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,"22 and because of the abundance of milk which they shall give, he will eat curds, for everyone left in the land will eat curds and honey. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,"23 At that time, where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels, there will be nothing but briers and thorns. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,"24 Men will go there to hunt with bows, because all the land will be briers and thorns. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,7,"25 They will stay away from all the hills that were cultivated with the hoe, for fear of the briers and thorns; but it will be a place where cattle and sheep graze. 8 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,8,"1 Yahweh said to me, “Take a large tablet and write on it, 'Maher-Shalal-Hash- Baz.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,8,"2 I will summon faithful witnesses to attest for me, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,8,"3 I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then Yahweh said to me, “Call his name Maher-Shalal-Hash- Baz. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,8,"4 For before the child knows to cry, 'My father,' and, 'My mother,' the riches of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried away by the king of Assyria.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,8,"5 Yahweh spoke to me again, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,8,"6 “Because this people has refused the gentle waters of Shiloah, and is happy over Rezin and Remaliah's son, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,8,"7 therefore the Lord is about to bring up on them the waters of the River, mighty and many, the king of Assyria and all his glory. It will come up over all its channels and overflow its banks. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,8,"8 The River will sweep onward into Judah, flooding and passing on, until it reaches to your neck. Its outstretched wings will fill the breadth of your land, Immanuel.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,8,"9 You peoples will be broken to pieces. Listen, all you distant countries arm yourselves for war and be broken in pieces; arm yourselves and be broken in pieces. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,8,"10 Form a plan, but it will not be carried out; issue the command, but it will not be carried out, for God is with us. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,8,"11 Yahweh spoke to me, with his strong hand upon me, and warned me not to walk in the way of this people. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,8,"12 Do not call conspiracy anything that this people calls conspiracy, you will not fear what they fear, and do not be terrified."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,8,"13 It is Yahweh of hosts whom you will honor as holy; he is the one you must fear, and he is the one you must dread. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,8,"14 He will become a sanctuary; but he will be a stone of striking, and a rock of stumbling— for both the houses of Israel, and he will be a trap and a snare to the people of Jerusalem. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,8,"15 Many will stumble over it and fall and be broken, and be ensnared and captured. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,8,"16 Bind up my testimony, seal the official record, and give it to my disciples. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,8,"17 I will wait for Yahweh, who hides his face from the house of Jacob; I will trust in him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,8,"18 See, I and the sons whom Yahweh has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Yahweh of hosts, who lives on Mount Zion. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,8,"19 They will say to you, “Consult with the mediums and spiritists,” those who chirp and mutter incantations. But should a people not consult their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,8,"20 To the law and to the testimony! If they do not say such things, it is because they have no light of dawn. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,8,"21 They will pass through the land greatly distressed and hungry. When they are hungry, they will become angry and curse their king and their God, as they turn their faces upward. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,8,"22 They will look at the earth and see distress, darkness, and oppressive gloom. They will be driven into a land of darkness. 9 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,9,"1 The gloom will be dispelled from her who was in anguish. In an earlier time he humiliated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the later time he will make it glorious, the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,9,"2 The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who have lived in the land of the shadow of death, the light has shone on them. * "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,9,"3 You have multiplied the nation; you have increased their joy. They rejoice before you like the joy at harvest time, as men rejoice when they divide the plunder. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,9,"4 For the yoke of his burden, the beam across his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have shattered as on the day of Midian. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,9,"5 For every boot treading in the tumult and the garments rolled in blood will be burned, fuel for the fire. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,9,"6 For to us a child has been born, to us a son has been given; and the rule will be on his shoulder; and his name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,9,"7 Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, as he rules on the throne of David, and over his kingdom, to establish it and sustain it * with justice and with righteousness from this time onward and for evermore.The zeal of Yahweh of hosts will do this."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,9,"8 The Lord sent a word against Jacob, and it fell on Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,9,"9 All the people will know, even Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, who say in pride and with an arrogant heart, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,9,"10 “The bricks have fallen, but we will rebuild with chiseled stone; the sycamores have been cut down, but we will put cedars in their place.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,9,"11 Therefore Yahweh will raise up against him Rezin, his adversary, and will stir up his enemies, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,9,"12 the Arameans on the east, and the Philistines on the west. They will devour Israel with open mouth. In all these things, his anger does not subside; instead, his hand is still stretched out. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,9,"13 Yet the people will not turn to him who struck them, nor will they seek Yahweh of hosts. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,9,"14 Therefore Yahweh will cut off from Israel head and tail, palm branch and reed, in one day. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,9,15 The leader and the noble man are the head; and the prophet that teaches lies is the tail. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,9,"16 Those who lead this people lead them astray, and those who are led by them are swallowed up. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,9,"17 Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men nor will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows, since every one is godless and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks foolish things.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,26,"18 We have been pregnant, we have been in labor, but it is as if we have only given birth to wind. We have not brought salvation to the earth, and the inhabitants of the world have not fallen. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,26,"19 Your dead will live; their dead bodies will arise. Awake and sing for joy, you who live in the dust; for your dew is the dew of light, and the earth will bring forth its dead. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,26,"20 Go, my people, enter into your rooms and shut your doors behind you; hide for a little while, until the indignation has passed by. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,26,"21 For, look, Yahweh is about to come out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; the earth will uncover her bloodshed, and will no longer conceal her slain. 27 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,27,"1 On that day Yahweh with his hard, great and fierce sword will punish Leviathan the slithering serpent, Leviathan the squirming serpent, and he will kill the monster that is in the sea. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,27,7 Has Yahweh attacked Jacob and Israel as he attacked those nations who attacked them? Have Jacob and Israel been killed as in the slaughter of those nations that were killed by them? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,27,"8 In exact measure you have contended, sending Jacob and Israel away; he drove them away with his fierce breath in the day of the east wind. * "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,27,"9 So in this way, the iniquity of Jacob will be atoned for, for this will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin when he will make all the altar stones as chalk and crushed to pieces, and no Asherah poles or incense altars will remain standing. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,27,"10 For the fortified city is desolate, the habitation is deserted and forsaken like the wilderness. There a calf feeds, and there he lies down and consumes its branches. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,27,"11 When the boughs are withered, they will be broken off. Women will come and make fires with them, for this is not a people of understanding. Therefore their Maker will not have compassion on them, and he who made them will not be merciful to them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,27,"12 It will come about on that day that Yahweh will thresh from the Euphrates River to the Wadi of Egypt and you, the people of Israel, will be gathered together one by one. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,27,"13 On that day a great trumpet will be blown; and the perishing ones in the land of Assyria will come, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, they will worship Yahweh on the holy mountain in Jerusalem. 28 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"1 Woe to the proud garland crown that is worn by each of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of its glorious beauty, the garland that is set on the head of the lush Valley of those who are overcome with wine! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"2 Behold, the Lord sends one who is mighty and strong; like a storm of hail and a destructive windstorm, like a driving rain and overflowing waters; and he will throw each garland crown down to the ground. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,3 The proud garland of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden underfoot. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"4 The fading flower of his glorious beauty, that is on the head of the rich valley, will be as the first ripe fig before the summer, that, when someone sees it, while it is yet in his hand, he gulps it down. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"5 In that day Yahweh of hosts will become a beautiful crown and a diadem of beauty for the remainder of his people, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"6 a spirit of justice for him who sits in judgment, and strength for those who turn back their enemies at their gates. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"7 But even these reel with wine, and stagger with strong drink. The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink, and they are swallowed up by wine. They stagger with strong drink, staggering in vision and reeling in decision. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"8 Truly, all tables are covered with vomit, so that there is no clean place. *"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"9 To whom will he teach knowledge, and to whom will he explain the message? To those who are weaned from milk or to those just taken from the breasts? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"10 For it is command upon command, command upon command; rule upon rule, rule upon rule; here a little, there a little. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"11 Indeed, with mocking lips and a foreign tongue he will speak to this people. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"12 In the past he said to them “This is the rest, give rest to him who is weary; and this is the refreshing,” but they would not listen. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"13 So the word of Yahweh will be to them command upon command, command upon command; rule upon rule, rule upon rule; here a little, there a little; so that they may go and fall backward, and be broken, ensnared, and captured. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"14 So listen to the word of Yahweh, you who mock, you who rule over this people who are in Jerusalem. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"15 This will happen because you said, “We have made a covenant with death, and with Sheol we have reached an agreement. So when the overwhelming whip passes through, it will not reach us. For we have made a lie our refuge, and taken shelter in falsehood.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"16 Therefore the Lord Yahweh says, “See, I will lay in Zion a foundation stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation. He who believes will not be ashamed. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"17 I will make justice the measuring stick, and righteousness the plumbline. Hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and the floodwaters will overwhelm the hiding place. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"18 Your covenant with death will be dissolved, and your agreement with Sheol will not stand. When the raging flood passes through, you will be overwhelmed by it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"19 Whenever it passes through, it will overwhelm you, and morning by morning it will pass through and by day and night it will come. When the message is understood, it will cause terror. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"20 For the bed is too short for a man to stretch out on, and the blanket too narrow for him to wrap himself in.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"21 Yahweh will rise up as on Mount Perazim; he will rouse himself as in the Valley of Gibeon to do his work, his strange work, and perform his strange deed. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"22 Now therefore do not mock, or your bonds will be tightened. I have heard from the Lord Yahweh of hosts, a decree of destruction on the earth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,23 Pay attention and listen to my voice; be attentive and listen to my words. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"24 Does a farmer who plows all day to sow, only plow the ground? Does he continually break up and harrow the field? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"25 When he has prepared the ground, does he not scatter caraway seed, sow the cumin, put in the wheat in rows and the barley in the right place, and the spelt at its edges? * "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,26 His God instructs him; he teaches him wisely. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"27 Moreover, the caraway seed is not threshed with a sledge, nor is a cartwheel rolled over the cumin; but caraway is beaten with a stick, and cumin with a rod. *"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"28 Grain is ground for bread but not too finely, and though the wheels of his cart and his horses scatter it, his horses do not crush it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,28,"29 This too comes from Yahweh of hosts, who is wonderful in instruction and excellent in wisdom. 29 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,29,"1 Woe to Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! Add year to year; let the festivals come round. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,29,"2 But I will besiege Ariel, and she will be mourning and lamenting; and she will be to me like Ariel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,29,"3 I will encamp against you in a circle and will lay siege against you with a palisade, and I will raise siege works against you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,29,"4 You will be brought down and will speak from the ground; your speech will be low from the dust. Your voice will sound like a spirit that speaks from the ground, and out of the dust your speech will whisper. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,29,"5 The great number of your invaders will become like fine dust, and the multitude of the ruthless ones as chaff that passes away. It will happen suddenly, in an instant. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,29,"6 Yahweh of hosts will come to you with thunder, earthquake, great noise, with strong winds and violent storm, and the flames of a devouring fire. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,29,"7 It will be like a dream, a vision of the night A horde of all the nations will fight against Ariel and her stronghold. They will attack her and her fortifications to press upon her. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,29,"8 It will be like when a hungry man dreams he is eating, but when he awakes, his stomach is empty. It will be like when a thirsty man dreams that he is drinking, but he when he awakes, he is fainting, with his thirst not quenched. Yes, so will be the great number of nations that fights against Mount Zion. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,29,"9 Astonish yourselves and be astonished; blind yourselves and be blind! Be drunk, but not with wine; stagger, but not with beer. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,29,"10 For Yahweh has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep. He has closed your eyes, the prophets, and has covered your heads, the seers. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,29,"11 All revelation has become to you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men might give to one who is learned, saying, “Read this.” He also says, “I cannot, for it is sealed.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,29,"12 If the book is given to one who cannot read, saying, “Read this,” he says, “I cannot read.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,29,"13 The Lord said, “This people comes close to me with their mouths and honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. Their honor for me is only a commandment of men that has been taught. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,29,"14 Therefore, see, I will proceed to do a marvelous thing among this people, wonder after wonder. The wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding of their prudent men will disappear.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,29,"15 Woe to those who deeply hide their plans from Yahweh, and whose deeds are in darkness. They say, “Who sees us, and who knows us?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,29,"16 You turn things upside down! Should the potter be considered like clay, so that the thing that is made should say about him who made it, “He did not make me,” or the thing formed say about him who formed it, “He does not understand”?"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,29,"17 In just a little while, Lebanon will be turned into a field, and the field will become a forest. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,29,"19 The oppressed will again rejoice in Yahweh, and the poor among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,29,"20 For the ruthless will cease, and the scoffer will vanish. All those who love to do evil will be eliminated, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,29,21 who by a word make a man out to be an offender. They lay a snare for him who seeks justice at the gate and put the righteous down with empty lies. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,29,"22 Therefore this is what Yahweh says concerning the house of Jacob—Yahweh, who redeemed Abraham, “Jacob will no longer be ashamed, nor will his face be pale. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,29,"23 But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, they will make my name holy. They will make holy the name of the Holy One of Jacob and they will stand in awe of the God of Israel. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,30,"1 “Woe to the rebellious children,” this is Yahweh's declaration. “They make plans, but not from me; they make alliances with other nations, but they were not directed by my Spirit, so they add sin to sin. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,30,"2 They set out to go down into Egypt, but have not asked for my direction. They seek protection from Pharaoh and take refuge in the shadow of Egypt. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,30,"3 Therefore Pharaoh's protection will be your shame, and the refuge in Egypt's shade, your humiliation, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,30,"4 although their princes are at Zoan, and their messengers have come to Hanes. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,30,"7 For Egypt's help is worthless; therefore I have called her Rahab, who sits still. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,30,"8 Now go, write it in their presence on a tablet, and inscribe it on a scroll, that it may be preserved for the time to come as a testimony. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,30,"11 Turn aside from the way, stray off the path; cause the Holy One of Israel to cease speaking before our face.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,30,"12 Therefore the Holy One of Israel says, “Because you reject this word and trust in oppression and deceit and lean on it,"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,30,"13 so this sin will be to you like a broken part ready to fall, like a bulge in a high wall whose fall will happen suddenly, in an instant.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,30,"14 He will break it as a potter's vessel is broken; he will not spare it, so that there will not be found among its pieces a shard with which to scrape fire from the hearth, or to scoop up water out of the cistern. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,30,"26 The light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter, like the sunlight of seven days. Yahweh will bind up the breaking of his people and heal the bruises of his wounding them. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,30,"28 His breath is like an overflowing torrent that reaches up to the middle of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction. His breath is a bridle in the jaws of the peoples to cause them to wander away."

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,30,"31 For at the voice of Yahweh, Assyria will be shattered; he will strike them with a staff. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,30,32 Every stroke of the appointed rod that Yahweh will lay on them will be accompanied with the music of tambourines and harps as he battles and fights with them. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,30,"33 For a place of burning was prepared long ago. Indeed, it is prepared for the king, and God has made it deep and wide. The pile is ready with a fire and much wood. The breath of Yahweh, like a stream of brimstone, will set it on fire. 31 "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,31,"2 Yet he is wise, and he will bring disaster and will not retract his words. He will arise against the evil house and against the helpers of those who commit sin. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,31,"3 Egypt is a man and not God, their horses flesh and not spirit. When Yahweh reaches out with his hand, both the one who helps will stumble, and the one who is helped will fall; both will perish together. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,31,"4 This is what Yahweh says to me, “As a lion, even a young lion, growls over its torn prey, when a group of shepherds is called out against it, but it does not tremble at their voices, nor creep away from their sound; thus Yahweh of hosts will descend to fight on Mount Zion, on that hill.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,32,"3 Then the eyes of those who see will not be dim, and the ears of those who hear will hear attentively."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,32,"4 The rash will think carefully with understanding, and the stutterer will speak distinctly and with ease. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,32,"5 The fool will no longer be called honorable, nor the deceiver called principled. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,32,"6 For the fool speaks folly, and his heart plans evil and godless actions, and he speaks wrongly against Yahweh. He makes the hungry empty, and the thirsty he causes to lack drink. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,32,"7 The deceiver's methods are evil. He devises wicked schemes to ruin the poor with lies, even when the poor say what is right. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,32,8 But the honorable man makes honorable plans; and because of his honorable actions he will stand.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,32,"13 The land of my people will be overgrown with thorns and briers, even in all the once joyful houses in the city of revelry. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,32,"14 For the palace will be forsaken, the crowded city will be deserted; the hill and the watchtower will become caves forever, a joy of wild donkeys, a pasture of flocks; "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,32,"15 until the Spirit is poured on us from on high, and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the fruitful field is considered as a forest. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,32,16 Then justice will reside in the wilderness; and righteousness will live in the fruitful field. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,32,"17 The work of righteousness will be peace; and the result of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,32,"18 My people will live in a peaceful habitation, in secure homes, and in quiet resting places. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,32,"19 But even if it hails and the forest is destroyed, and the city is completely annihilated, "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,33,"3 At the loud noise the peoples flee; when you arise, the nations are scattered. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,33,"4 Your spoil is gathered as the locusts gather; as locusts leap, men leap on it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,33,5 Yahweh is exalted. He lives in a high place. He will fill Zion with justice and righteousness. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,33,"6 He will be the stability in your times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge; the fear of Yahweh is his treasure. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,33,"7 Look, their envoys cry in the streets; the diplomats hoping for peace weep bitterly."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,33,"8 The highways are deserted; there are no more travelers. Covenants are broken, witnesses are despised, and mankind is not respected. * "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,33,9 The land mourns and withers away; Lebanon is ashamed and withers away; † Sharon is like a desert plain; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,33,"10 “Now will I arise,” says Yahweh; “now I will be lifted up; now I will be elevated. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,33,"11 You conceive chaff, and you give birth to stubble; your breath is a fire that will consume you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,33,"12 The peoples will be burned to lime, as thornbushes are cut down and are burned. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,33,"13 You who are far away, hear what I have done; and, you who are near, acknowledge my might.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,33,14 The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling has seized the godless ones. Who among us can sojourn with a raging fire? Who among us can sojourn with everlasting burnings? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,33,"15 He who walks righteously and speaks honestly; who despises the gain of oppression, who shakes his hand so that it will not accept a bribe, who stops his ears from hearing about bloodshed, and who shuts his eyes from looking on evil— "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,33,"16 this is the man who will dwell on the heights, his place of defense will be the fortress among the cliffs, his food will be given, and his water will be in steady supply. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,33,17 Your eyes will see the king in his beauty; they will see a land off in the distance. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,33,"18 Your heart will recall the terror; where is the scribe, where is he who weighed the money? Where is he who counted the towers? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,33,"19 You will no longer see the defiant people, a people of a strange language that you do not understand. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,33,"20 Look at Zion, the city of our feasts; your eyes will see Jerusalem as a quiet habitation, a tent that will not be removed, whose stakes will never be pulled up nor will any of its cords be broken. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,33,"21 Instead, Yahweh in majesty will be with us, in a place of broad rivers and streams. No warship with oars will travel it, and no large ships will sail by. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,33,"22 For Yahweh is our judge, Yahweh is our lawgiver, Yahweh is our king; he will save us. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,33,"23 Your riggings are slack; they cannot hold the mast in place; they cannot spread the sail; when the great spoil is divided, even the lame will drag off the spoil. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,33,"24 The inhabitants will not say, “I am sick;” the people who live there will be forgiven for their iniquity. 34 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,34,"1 Come near, you nations, and listen; pay attention, you people! The earth and all that fills it must listen, the world, and all things that come from it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,34,"2 For Yahweh is angry with all the nations, and furious against all their armies; he has completely destroyed them, he has handed them over to the slaughter. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,34,3 The bodies of their dead will be thrown out. The stench of the dead bodies will be everywhere; and the mountains will soak up their blood. *
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,34,"4 All the stars of the sky will fade away, and the sky will be rolled up like a scroll; and all their stars will fade away, as the leaf fades from off the vine, and as the overripe figs from the fig tree. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,34,"5 For when my sword will have drunk its fill in heaven; look, it will now come down on Edom, on the people I am setting apart for destruction. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,34,"6 The sword of Yahweh is dripping with blood and covered with fat, dripping with the blood of lambs and goats, covered with the fat of the kidneys of rams. For Yahweh has a sacrifice in Bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of Edom. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,34,"7 Wild oxen will fall with them, and young bulls with the older ones. Their land will be drunk with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,34,8 For it will be a day of vengeance for Yahweh and a year when he will pay them back for the cause of Zion. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,34,"9 The streams of Edom will be turned into pitch, her dust into sulfur, and her land will become burning pitch. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,34,10 It will burn night and day; its smoke will rise forever; from generation to generation it will be a wasteland; no one will pass through it forever and ever. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,34,11 But wild birds and animals will live there; the owl and the raven will make their nest in it. He will stretch over it the measuring line of ruin and the plumbline of destruction. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,34,"12 Her nobles will have nothing left to call a kingdom, and all her princes will be nothing. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,34,"13 Thorns will overgrow her palaces, nettles and thistles her fortresses. It will be a habitation of jackals, a place for ostriches. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,34,"14 The wild animals and the hyenas will meet there, and the wild goats will cry to one another. Nocturnal animals will settle there and find for themselves a place of rest. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,34,"15 Owls will make nests, lay and hatch their eggs, hatch and protect their young. Yes, there hawks will gather, each one with its mate. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,34,"16 Search through the scroll of Yahweh; not one of these will be missing. None will lack for a mate; for his mouth has commanded it, and his spirit has gathered them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,34,"17 He has cast lots for their places, and his hand has measured it out for them by a cord. They will possess it forever; from generation to generation they will live there. 35 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,35,"1 The wilderness and the Arabah will be glad; and the desert will rejoice and blossom. Like the rose, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,35,"2 it will blossom abundantly and rejoice with joy and singing; the glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon; they will see the glory of Yahweh, the splendor of our God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,35,"3 Strengthen the weak hands, and steady the knees that shake. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,35,"4 Say to those with a fearful heart, “Be strong, do not fear! Look, your God will come with vengeance, with the recompense of God. He will come and save you.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,35,"5 Then the eyes of the blind will see, and the ears of the deaf will hear. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,35,"6 Then the lame man will leap like a deer, and the mute tongue will sing, for water breaks out in the Arabah, and streams in the wilderness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,35,"7 The burning sand will become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water; in the habitation of jackals, where they once lay, will be grass with reeds andrushes."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,35,8 A highway will be there called The Holy Way. The unclean will not travel it. But it will be for him who walks in it. No fool will go on it. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,35,"9 No lion will be there, no ferocious beast will be on it; they will not be found there, but the redeemed will walk there. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,35,"10 The ransomed of Yahweh will return and come with singing to Zion, and everlasting joy will be on their heads; gladness and joy will overtake them; sorrow and sighing will flee away. 36 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,36,"1 In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,36,"2 Then the king of Assyria sent the chief commander from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a great army. He approached the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway to the launderers' field, and stood by it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,36,"3 The Israelite officials who went out of the city to talk with them were Hilkiah's son Eliakim, the palace administrator, Shebna the king's secretary, and Asaph's son Joah, who wrote down the government decisions. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,36,"4 The chief commander said to them, “Tell Hezekiah that the great king, the king of Assyria, says, 'What is the source of your confidence? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,36,"5 You speak only useless words, saying there is counsel and strength for war. Now in whom are you trusting? Who has given you courage to rebel against me? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,36,"6 Look, you are trusting in Egypt, that splintered reed that you use as a walking staff, but if a man leans on it, it will stick into his hand and pierce it. That is what Pharaoh king of Egypt is to anyone who trusts in him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,36,"7 But if you say to me, “We are trusting in Yahweh our God,” is not he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, “You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem”? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,36,"8 Now therefore, I want to make you a good offer from my master the king of Assyria. I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able to find riders for them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,36,9 How could you resist even one captain of the least of my master's servants? You have put your trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen! 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,36,"10 Now then, have I traveled up here without Yahweh to fight against this land and destroy it? Yahweh said to me, “Attack this land and destroy it.”'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,36,"11 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah said to the chief commander, “Please speak to your servants in the Aramean language, Aramaic, for we understand it. Do not speak with us in the language of Judah in the ears of the people who are on the wall.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,36,"12 But the chief commander said, “Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words? Has he not sent me to the men who sit on the wall, who will have to eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,36,"13 Then the chief commander stood and shouted in a loud voice in the Jews' language, saying, “Listen to the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,36,"14 The king says, 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to rescue you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,36,"15 Do not let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, “Yahweh will surely rescue us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,36,"16 Do not listen to Hezekiah, for this is what the king of Assyria says 'Make peace with me and come out to me. Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and from his own fig tree, and drink from the water in his own cistern. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,36,"17 You will do this until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,36,"18 Do not let Hezekiah mislead you, saying, 'Yahweh will rescue us.' Has any of the gods of the peoples rescued them from the hand of the king of Assyria? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,36,19 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they rescued Samaria from my power? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,36,"20 Among all the gods of these lands, is there any god who has rescued his land from my power, as if Yahweh could save Jerusalem from my power?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,36,"21 But the people remained silent and did not respond, for the king's order was, “Do not answer him.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,36,"22 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and reported to him the words of the chief commander. 37 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"1 It came about that when King Hezekiah heard their report, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"2 He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, all covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah son of Amoz, the prophet. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"3 They said to him, “Hezekiah says, 'This day is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace, like when a child is ready to be born, but the mother has no strength to give birth to her child. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"4 It may be Yahweh your God will hear the words of the chief commander, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard. Now lift up your prayer for the remnant that is still here.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"5 So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"6 and Isaiah said to them, “Say to your master 'Yahweh says, “Do not be afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have insulted me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"7 Look, I will put a spirit in him, and he will hear a certain report and go back to his own land. I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.”'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"8 Then the chief commander returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that the king had gone away from Lachish. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"9 Then Sennacherib heard that Tirhakah king of Cush and Egypt had mobilized to fight against him, so he sent messengers again to Hezekiah with a message "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"10 “Say to Hezekiah, king of Judah, 'Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"11 See, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them completely. So will you be rescued? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"12 Have the gods of the nations rescued them, the nations that my fathers destroyed Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden in Tel Assar? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"13 Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the cities of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,14 Hezekiah received this letter from hand of the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the house of Yahweh and spread it before him. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,15 Hezekiah prayed to Yahweh 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"16 “Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, you who sit above the cherubim, you are God alone over all the kingdoms of the earth. You made the heavens and the earth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"17 Turn your ear, Yahweh, and listen. Open your eyes, Yahweh, and see, and hear the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"18 It is true, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the nations and their lands. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"19 They have put their gods into the fire, for they were not gods but the work of men's hands, just wood and stone. So the Assyrians have destroyed them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"20 So now, Yahweh our God, save us from his power, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are Yahweh alone.”"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"21 Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah, saying, “Yahweh, the God of Israel says, 'Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,22 this is the word that Yahweh has spoken about him “The virgin daughter of Zion despises you and laughs you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head at you. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,23 Whom have you defied and insulted? Against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"24 By your servants you have defied the Lord and have said, 'With the multitude of my chariots I have gone up to the heights of the mountains, to the highest elevations of Lebanon. I will cut down its tall cedars and choice cypress trees there, and I will enter into its farthest high places, its most fruitful forest. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,25 I have dug wells and drunk water; * I dried up all the rivers of Egypt under the soles of my feet.' 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,26 Have you not heard how I determined it long ago and worked it out in ancient times? Now I am bringing it to pass. You are here to reduce impregnable cities into heaps of ruins. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"27 Their inhabitants, of little strength, are shattered and ashamed. They are plants in the field, green grass, the grass on the roof or in the field, before the east wind. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"28 But I know your sitting down, your going out, your coming in, and your raging against me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"29 Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance has reached my ears, I will put my hook in your nose, and my bit in your mouth; I will turn you back the way you came.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"30 This will be the sign for you This year you will eat what grows wild, and in the second year what grows from that. But in the third year you must plant and harvest, plant vineyards and eat their fruit. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,31 The remnant of the house of Judah that survives will again take root and bear fruit. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,32 For from Jerusalem a remnant will come out; from Mount Zion survivors will come. The zeal of Yahweh of hosts will do this.'” 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,33 Therefore Yahweh says this about the king of Assyria “He will not come into this city and he will not shoot an arrow here. He will not come before it with shield or build up a siege ramp against it. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,34 The way by which he came will be the same way he will leave; he will not enter this city—this is Yahweh's declaration. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"35 For I will defend this city and rescue it, for my own sake and for David my servant's sake.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"36 Then the angel of Yahweh went out and attacked the camp of the Assyrians, putting to death 185,"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"000 soldiers. When the men arose early in the morning, dead bodies lay everywhere. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,37 So Sennacherib king of Assyria left Israel and went home and stayed in Nineveh. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,37,"38 Later, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisrok his god, his sons Adrammelek * and Sharezer killed him with the sword. Then they escaped into the landof Ararat. Then Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,38,"1 In those days Hezekiah was sick to the point of dying. So Isaiah son of Amoz, the prophet, came to him, and said to him, “Yahweh says, 'Set your house in order; for you will die, not live.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,38,2 Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,38,"3 He said, “Please, Yahweh, call to mind how I have faithfully walked before you with my whole heart, and how I have done what was good in your sight.” Then Hezekiah wept loudly. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,38,"4 Then the word of Yahweh came to Isaiah, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,38,"5 “Go and say to Hezekiah, the leader of my people, 'This is what Yahweh, the God of David your ancestor, says I have heard your prayer, and I have seen your tears. See, I am about to add fifteen years to your life. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,38,"6 Then I will rescue you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,38,"7 This will be the sign to you from Yahweh, that I will do what I have promised. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,38,"8 Look, I will cause the shadow on the stairs of Ahaz to go back ten steps.'” So the shadow went back ten steps of the stairs on which it had advanced. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,38,"9 This was the written prayer of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick and then recovered "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,38,10 “I said that halfway through my life I will go through the gates of Sheol; I am sent there for the rest of my years. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,38,"11 I said that I will no longer see Yahweh, Yahweh in the land of the living; I will no longer look on mankind or the inhabitants of the world. * "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,38,12 My life is removed and carried away from me like a shepherd's tent; I have rolled up my life like a weaver; you are cutting me off from the loom; between day and night you are ending my life. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,38,13 I cried out† until the morning; like a lion he breaks all my bones. Between day and night you are ending my life. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,38,"14 Like a swallow I chirp; I coo like a dove; my eyes grow tired with looking upward. Lord, I am oppressed; help me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,38,"15 What shall I say? He has both spoken to me, and has done it; I will walk slowly all my years because I am overcome with grief. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,38,"16 Lord, the sufferings you send are good for me; may my life be given back to me; you have restored my life and health. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,38,17 It was for my benefit that I experienced such grief. You have rescued me from the pit of destruction; for you have thrown all my sins behind your back. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,38,18 For Sheol does not thank you; death does not praise you; those who go down into the pit do not hope in your trustworthiness. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,38,"19 The living person, the living person, he is the one who gives you thanks, as I do this day; a father makes known to children your trustworthiness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,38,"20 Yahweh is about to save me, and we will celebrate with music all the days of our lives in the house of Yahweh.” *"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,38,"21 Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take a lump of figs and put it on the boil, and he will recover.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,38,"22 Hezekiah also had said, “What will be the sign that I should go up to the house of Yahweh?” 39 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,39,"1 At that time Marduk-Baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick and had recovered. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,39,"2 Hezekiah was pleased by these things; he showed the messengers his storehouse of valuable things—the silver, the gold, the spices and precious oil, the storehouse of his weapons, and all that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his kingdom, that Hezekiah did not show them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,39,"3 Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and asked him, “What did these men say to you? Where did they come from?” Hezekiah said, “They came to me from the distant country of Babylon.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,39,"4 Isaiah asked, “What have they seen in your house?” Hezekiah answered, “They have seen everything in my house. There is nothing among my valuable things that I have not shown them.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,39,"5 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Listen to the word of Yahweh of hosts 6 'Look, the days are about to come when everything in your palace, the things that your ancestors stored away until this present day, will be carried to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,39,"6 'Look, the days are about to come when everything in your palace, the things that your ancestors stored away until this present day, will be carried to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,39,"7 The sons born from you, whom you yourself have fathered—they will take them away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,39,"8 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of Yahweh that you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “There will be peace and stability in my days.” 40 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,"1 “Comfort, comfort my people,” says your God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,"2 “Speak tenderly to Jerusalem; and proclaim to her that her warfare has ended, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she has received double from Yahweh's hand for all her sins.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,"3 A voice cries out, “In the wilderness prepare the way of Yahweh; make straight in the Arabah a highway for our God.” * "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,"4 Every valley will be lifted up, and every mountain and hill will be leveled; and the rugged land will be made level, and the rough places a plain; "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,"5 and the glory of Yahweh will be revealed, and all people will see it together; for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,"6 A voice says, “Cry.” Another answers, “What should I cry?” “All flesh is grass, and all their covenant faithfulness is like the flower of the field. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,7 The grass withers and the flower wilts when the breath of Yahweh blows on it; surely humanity is grass. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,"8 The grass withers, the flower wilts, but the word of our God will stand forever.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,"9 Go up on a high mountain, Zion, bearer of good news. † Shout out loud, Jerusalem. You who bring good news, raise your voice, do not be afraid. ‡ Say to the cities of Judah, “Here is your God!” *"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,"10 Look, the Lord Yahweh comes as a victorious warrior, and his strong arm rules for him. See, his reward is with him, and those he has rescued go before him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,"11 He will feed his flock like a shepherd, he will gather in his arm the lambs, and carry them close to his heart, and will gently lead the ewes nursing their young. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,"12 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, measured the sky with the span of his hand, held the dust of the earth in a basket, weighed the mountains in scales, or the hills in a balance? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,"13 Who has comprehended the mind of Yahweh, or instructed him as his counselor? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,"14 From whom did he ever receive instruction? Who taught him the correct way to do things, and taught him knowledge, or showed to him the way of understanding? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,"15 Look, the nations are like a drop in a bucket, and are regarded like the dust on the scales; see, he weighs the isles as a speck. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,"16 Lebanon is not sufficient fuel, nor its wild animals sufficient for a burnt offering. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,17 All the nations are insufficient before him; they are regarded by him as nothing. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,18 To whom then will you compare God? To what idol will you liken him? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,19 An idol! A craftsman casts it The goldsmith overlays it with gold and forges silver chains for it. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,20 To make an offering one chooses a wood that will not rot; he seeks a skillful artisan to make an idol that will not fall over. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,21 Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,22 He is the one who sits above the horizon of the earth; and the inhabitants are like grasshoppers before him. He stretches out the heavens like a curtain and spreads them out as a tent to live in. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,23 He reduces rulers to nothing and makes the rulers of the earth insignificant. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,"24 They are barely planted, barely sown, their stem has barely taken root in the earth, when he blows upon them and they wither, and the wind carries them away like straw. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,"25 “To whom then will you compare me, whom do I resemble?” says the Holy One. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,"26 Look up at the sky! Who has created all these stars? He leads out their formations and calls them all by name. By the greatness of his might and by the strength of his power, not one is missing. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,"27 Why do you say, Jacob, and declare, Israel, “My way is hidden from Yahweh, and my God is not concerned about my vindication”? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,"28 Have you not known? Have you not heard? The everlasting God, Yahweh, the Creator of the ends of the earth, does not get tired or weary; there is no limit to his understanding. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,29 He gives strength to the tired; and to the weak he gives renewed energy. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,"30 Even young people become tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,40,31 but those who wait for Yahweh will renew their strength; they will soar with wings like eagles; they will run and not be weary; they will walk and not faint.
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"1 “Listen before me in silence, you coastlands; let the nations renew their strength; let them come near and speak; let us come near together to argue a dispute. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"2 Who has stirred up one from the east, calling him in righteousness to his service? He hands nations over to him and helps him subdue kings. He turns them to dust with his sword, like windblown stubble with his bow. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"3 He pursues them and passes by safely, by a swift path that his feet scarcely touch. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"4 Who has performed and accomplished these deeds? Who has summoned the generations from the beginning? I, Yahweh, the first, and with the last ones, I am he. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,5 The isles have seen and are afraid; the ends of the earth tremble; they approach and come. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"6 Everyone helps his neighbor, and every one says to one another, 'Be encouraged.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"7 So the carpenter encourages the goldsmith, and he who works with the hammer encourages him who works with an anvil, saying of the welding, 'It is good.' They fasten it with nails so it will not topple over. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"8 But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the offspring of Abraham my friend, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"9 you whom I am bringing back from the ends of the earth, and whom I called from the far away places, and to whom I said, 'You are my servant;' I have chosen you and not rejected you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"10 Do not fear, for I am with you. Do not be anxious, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, and I will help you, and I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"11 See, they will be ashamed and disgraced, all who have been angry with you; they will be as nothing and will perish, those who oppose you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"12 You will seek and will not find those who contended with you; those who warred against you will be like nothing, absolutely nothing. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"13 For I, Yahweh your God, will hold your right hand, saying to you, 'Do not fear; I am helping you.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"14 Do not fear, Jacob you worm, and you men of Israel; I will help you—this is Yahweh's declaration, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"15 Look, I am making you like a sharp threshing sledge, new and two-edged; you will thresh the mountains and crush them; you will make the hills like chaff. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"16 You will winnow them, and the wind will carry them away; the wind will scatter them. You will rejoice in Yahweh, you will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"17 The oppressed and needy look for water, but there is none, and their tongues are parched for thirst; I, Yahweh, will respond to their prayers; I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"18 I will make streams to flow down the slopes, and springs in the middle of the valleys; I will make the desert into a pool of water, and the dry land into springs of water."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"19 In the wilderness I will set the cedar, the acacia, and the myrtle, and the olive tree. I will set the cypress in the desert plain, with the pines and the cypress box trees. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"20 I will do this so that the people may see, recognize, and understand together, that the hand of Yahweh has done this, that the Holy One of Israel has created it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"21 “Present your case,” says Yahweh, “present your best arguments for your idols,” says the King of Jacob. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"22 Let them bring us their own arguments; have them come forward and declare to us what will happen, so we may know these things well. Have them tell us of earlier predictive declarations, so we can reflect on them and know how they were fulfilled. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"23 Tell things about the future, that we may know if you are gods; do something good or evil, that we may be frightened and impressed. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"24 See, you idols are nothing and your deeds are nothing; the one who chooses you is detestable. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"25 I have raised up one from the north, and he comes; from the sun's rising I summon him who calls on my name, and he will trample the rulers like mud, like a potter who is treading on the clay. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"26 Who announced this from the beginning, that we might know? Before this time, that we may say, “He is right”? Indeed none of them decreed it, yes, none heard you say anything. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"27 I first said to Zion, “Look here they are;” I sent a herald to Jerusalem. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"28 When I look, there is no one, not one among them who can give good advice, who, when I ask, can answer a word. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,41,"29 Look, all of them are nothing, and their deeds are nothing; their cast metal figures are wind and emptiness. 42 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,"1 Behold, my servant, whom I uphold; my chosen one, in him I take delight. I have put my Spirit upon him; he will bring justice to the nations. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,"2 He will not cry out nor shout, nor make his voice heard in the streets. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,"3 A crushed reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not quench he will faithfully execute justice. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,4 He will not grow faint nor be discouraged until he has established justice on the earth; and the coastlands wait for his law. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,"5 This is what God Yahweh says— the one who created the heavens and stretched them out, the one who made the earth and all that it produces, the one who gives breath to the people on it and life to those who live on it "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,"6 “I, Yahweh, have called you in righteousness and will hold your hand. I will keep you and set you as a covenant for the people, as a light for the Gentiles, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,"7 to open the eyes of the blind, to release the prisoners from the dungeon, and from the house of confinement those who sit in darkness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,"8 I am Yahweh, that is my name; and my glory I will not share with another nor my praise with carved idols. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,"9 See, the previous things came to pass, now I am about to declare new events. Before they begin to occur I will tell you about them.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,"10 Sing to Yahweh a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth; you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it, the coastlands, and those wholive there."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,"11 Let the desert and the cities cry out, the villages where Kedar lives, shout for joy! Let the inhabitants of Sela sing; let them shout from the mountaintops. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,12 Let them give glory to Yahweh and declare his praise in the coastlands. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,"13 Yahweh will go out as a warrior; as a man of war he will stir up his zeal. He will shout, yes, he will roar his battle cries; he will show his enemies his power. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,14 I have kept quiet for a long time; I have been still and restrained myself; now I will cry out like a woman in labor; I will gasp and pant. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,15 I will lay waste mountains and hills and dry up all their vegetation; and I will turn the rivers into islands and will dry up the marshes. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,"16 I will bring the blind by a way that they do not know; in paths that they do not know I will lead them. I will turn the darkness into light before them, and make the crooked places straight. These things I will do, and I will not abandon them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,"17 They will be turned back, they will be completely put to shame, those who trust in carved figures, who say to cast metal figures, “You are our gods.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,"18 Listen, you deaf; and look, you blind, that you may see. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,"19 Who is blind but my servant? Or deaf like my messenger I send? Who is as blind as my covenant partner, or blind as Yahweh's servant? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,"20 You see many things, but do not comprehend; ears are open, but no one hears. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,21 It pleased Yahweh to praise his justice and to make his law glorious. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,"22 But this is a people robbed and plundered; they are all trapped in pits, held captive in prisons; they have become a plunder with no one to rescue them, and no one says, “Bring them back!” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,23 Who among you will listen to this? Who will listen and hear in the future? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,"24 Who gave Jacob over to the robber, and Israel to the looters? Was it not Yahweh, against whom we have sinned, in whose ways they refused to walk, and whose law they refused to obey? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,42,"25 Therefore he poured out on them his fierce anger and the violence of war, Its flames encircled them, yet they did not understand; it consumed them, but they did not take it to heart. 43 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"1 But now this is what Yahweh says, he who created you, Jacob, and he who formed you, Israel “Do not be afraid, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by your name, you are mine. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"2 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they will not overwhelm you. When you walk through the fire you will not be burned, and the flames will not destroy you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"3 For I am Yahweh your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. I have given Egypt as your ransom, Cush and Seba in exchange for you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"4 Since you are precious and special in my sight, I love you; therefore I will give people in exchange for you, and other peoples in exchange for your life."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"5 Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bring your offspring from the east, and gather you from the west. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"6 I will say to the north, 'Hand them over;' and to the south, 'Do not hold any back;' Bring my sons from afar, and my daughters from the remote regions of the earth, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"7 everyone who is called by my name, whom I have created for my glory, whom I have formed, yes, whom I have made. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"8 Bring out the people who are blind, even though they have eyes, and the deaf, even though they have ears. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"9 All the nations gather together, and the peoples assemble. Who among them could have declared this and announced to us earlier events? Let them bring their witnesses to prove themselves right, let them listen and affirm, 'It is true.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"10 You are my witnesses,” declares Yahweh, “and my servant whom I have chosen, so that you may know and believe in me, and understand that I am he. Before me there was no god formed, and there will be none after me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"11 I, I am Yahweh, and there is no savior but me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"12 I have declared, saved, and proclaimed, and there is no other god among you. You are my witnesses,” declares Yahweh, “I am God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"13 From this day on I am he, and no one can rescue anyone from my hand. I act, and who can turn it back?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"14 This is what Yahweh says, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel “For your sake I send to Babylon and lead them all down as fugitives, turning the Babylonians' expressions of joy into songs of lamentation. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"15 I am Yahweh, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"16 This is what Yahweh says (who opened a way through the sea and a path in the mighty waters, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"17 who led out the chariot and horse, the army and the mighty host. They fell down together; they will never rise again; they are extinguished, quenched like a burning wick.) "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"18 “Do not think about these former things, nor consider the things of long ago. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"19 Look, I am about to do a new thing; now it begins to happen; do you not perceive it? I will make a road in the desert and streams of water in the wilderness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"20 The wild animals of the field will honor me, the jackals and the ostriches, because I give water in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, for my chosen people to drink, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"21 this people whom I formed for myself, that they might recount my praises. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"22 But you have not called on me, Jacob; you have become tired of me, Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"23 You have not brought me any of your sheep as burnt offerings, or honored me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with grain offerings, nor wearied you with demands for incense. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"24 You have bought me no sweet-smelling cane with money, neither have you poured out to me the fat of your sacrifices; but you have burdened me with your sins, you have wearied me with your evil deeds. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"25 I, yes, I, am he who blots out your offenses for my own sake; and I will not call to mind your sins any longer. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"26 Remind me of what happened. Let us debate together; present your cause, that you may be proved innocent."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"27 Your first father sinned, and your leaders have transgressed against me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,43,"28 Therefore I will defile the holy officials; I will hand Jacob over to complete destruction, and Israel to abusive humiliation.” 44 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,44,"1 Now listen, Jacob my servant, and Israel, whom I have chosen "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,44,"2 This is what Yahweh says, he who made you and formed you in the womb and who will help you “Do not fear, Jacob my servant; and you, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,44,"3 For I will pour water on the thirsty ground, and flowing streams on the dry ground; I will pour my Spirit on your offspring, and my blessing on your children. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,44,"4 They will spring up among the grass, like willows by the streams of water. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,44,"5 One will say, 'I belong to Yahweh,' and another will call out the name of Jacob, and another will write on his hand 'Belonging to Yahweh,' and name himself by the name of Israel.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,44,"6 This is what Yahweh says—the King of Israel and his Redeemer, Yahweh of hosts “I am the first, and I am the last; and there is no God but me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,44,"7 Who is like me? Let him announce it and explain to me the events that occurred since I established my ancient people, and let them declare the events to come. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,44,"8 Do not fear or be afraid. Have I not declared to you long ago, and announced it? You are my witnesses Is there any God besides me? There is no other Rock; I know of none.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,44,"9 All who fashion idols are nothing; the things they delight in are worthless; their witnesses cannot see or know anything, and they will be put to shame. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,44,10 Who would form a god or cast an idol that is worthless? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,44,"11 Look, all his associates will be put to shame; the craftsmen are only men. Let them take their stand together; they will cower and be put to shame. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,44,"12 The smith works with his tools, forming it, working over the coals. He shapes it with hammers and works it with his strong arm. He is hungry, and his strength wanes; he drinks no water and becomes faint. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,44,"13 The carpenter measures the wood with a line, and marks it with a stylus. He shapes it with his tools and marks it out with a compass. He shapes it after the figure of a man, like an attractive human, so it may stay in a house. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,44,"14 He cuts down cedars, or chooses a cypress tree or an oak tree. He picks for himself trees in the forest. He plants a fir tree and the rain makes it grow. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,44,"15 Then a man uses it for a fire and warms himself. Yes, he kindles a fire and bakes bread. Then he makes from it a god and bows down to it; he makes an idol and bows down to it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,44,"16 He burns part of the wood for the fire, roasting his meat over it. He eats and is satisfied. He warms himself and says, “Ah, I am warm, I have seen the fire.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,44,"17 With the rest of the wood he makes a god, his carved image; he bows down to it and reverences it, and prays to it saying, “Rescue me, for you are my god.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,44,"18 They do not know, nor do they understand, for their eyes are blind and cannot see, and their hearts cannot perceive. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,44,"19 No one thinks, nor do they comprehend and say, “I have burned part of the wood in the fire; yes, I have also baked bread upon itscoals.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,53,"6 We all like sheep have gone astray; we have each turned to his own way, and Yahweh has placed on him the iniquity of us all. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,53,"7 He was oppressed; yet when he humbled himself, he did not open his mouth; as a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,53,8 By coercion and judgment he was condemned; who from that generation thought anymore about him? But he was cut off from the land of the living; because of the offenses of my people the penalty was put on him. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,53,"9 They placed his grave with the criminals, with a rich man in his death, although he had done no violence, nor had there been any deceit in his mouth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,53,"10 Yet it was Yahweh's will to crush him and make him ill. When he makes his life an offering for sin, he will see his offspring, he will prolong his days, and Yahweh's purpose will be accomplished through him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,53,"11 After the suffering of his life, he will see light and be satisfied by his knowledge. * My righteous servant will justify many; he will bear their iniquities. † "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,53,"12 Therefore will I give him his portion among the multitudes, and he will divide the spoils with the many, because he exposed himself to death and was numbered with the transgressors. He bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors. *"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,54,"1 “Sing, you barren woman, you who have not given birth; break into joyful singing and cry aloud, you who have never been in birth labor. For the children of the desolate one are more than the children of the married woman,” says Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,54,"2 “Make your tent larger and spread your tent curtains farther out, unsparingly; lengthen your ropes and strengthen your stakes. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,54,"3 For you will spread out to the right hand and to the left, and your descendants will conquer nations and resettle desolate cities. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,54,"4 Do not fear for you will not be ashamed, nor be discouraged for you will not be disgraced; you will forget the shame of your youth and the disgrace of your abandonment. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,54,5 For your Maker is your husband; Yahweh of hosts is his name. The Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; he is called the God of the whole earth. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,54,"6 For Yahweh has called you back as a wife abandoned and grieved in spirit, like a woman married young and rejected,” says your God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,54,"7 “For a short time I abandoned you, but with great compassion I will gather you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,54,"8 In a flood of anger I hid my face from you momentarily; but with everlasting covenant faithfulness I will have mercy on you— says Yahweh, the one who rescues you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,54,"9 For this is like the waters of Noah to me as I swore that the waters of Noah would never again pass over the earth, so have I sworn that I will not be angry with you or rebuke you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,54,"10 Though the mountains may fall and the hills be shaken, yet my steadfast love will not turn away from you, nor will my covenant of peace be shaken— says Yahweh, who has mercy on you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,54,"11 Afflicted one, storm-driven and uncomforted one, look, I will set your pavement in turquoise, and lay your foundations with sapphires. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,54,"12 I will make your pinnacles of rubies and your gates of sparkling stones, and your outer wall of beautiful stones. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,54,13 Then all your children will be taught by Yahweh; and the peace of your children will be great. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,54,"14 In righteousness you will be established, and you will be far from oppression, for you will not fear; and from terror, for it will not come near to you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,54,"15 Look, if anyone stirs up trouble, it will not be from me; anyone who stirs up trouble with you will fall in defeat. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,54,"16 See, I have created the craftsman, who blows the burning coals and forges weapons as his work, and I have created the destroyer to destroy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,54,"17 No weapon that is formed against you will succeed; and you will condemn everyone who accuses you. This is the heritage of the servants of Yahweh, and their vindication from me —this is Yahweh's declaration.” 55 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,55,"1 “Come, everyone who is thirsty, come to the water, and you who have no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,55,"2 Why do you weigh out silver for what is not bread, and why do you labor for what does not satisfy? Listen carefully to me and eat what is good, and delight yourselves in fatness."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,55,"3 Turn your ears and come to me! Listen, that you may live! I will make an everlasting covenant with you—my reliable, faithful love that I promised to David. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,55,"4 Look, I have placed him as a witness to the nations, as a leader and commander to the peoples. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,55,"5 Look, you will call to a nation that you did not know; and a nation that did not know you will run to you because of Yahweh your God, the Holy One of Israel, who has glorified you.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,55,6 Seek Yahweh while he may be found; call on him while he is nearby. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,55,"7 Let the wicked leave his path, and the man of sin his thoughts. Let him return to Yahweh, and he will pity him, and to our God, who will abundantly forgive him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,55,"8 “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways—this is Yahweh's declaration— "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,55,"9 for as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,55,"10 For as the rain and snow come down from heaven and do not return there unless they saturate the earth and make it produce and sprout and give seed to the farmer who sows and bread to the eater, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,55,"11 so also my word will be that goes from my mouth—it will not return to me empty, but it will achieve the purpose for which I sent it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,55,"12 For you will go out in joy and be led along peacefully; the mountains and the hills will break out in joyful shouts before you, and all the trees of the fields will clap their hands. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,55,"13 Instead of the thornbushes, the cypress will grow; and instead of the brier, the myrtle tree will grow, and it will be for Yahweh, for his name, as an everlasting sign that will not be cut off.” 56 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,56,"1 This is what Yahweh says, “Observe what is right, do what is just; for my salvation is near, and my righteousness is about to be revealed. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,56,"2 Blessed is the man that does this, and who holds it tightly. He observes the Sabbath, not defiling it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,56,"3 Let no foreigner who has become a follower of Yahweh say, “Yahweh will certainly exclude me from his people.” The eunuch should not say, “See, I am a dry tree.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,56,"4 For this is what Yahweh says, “To the eunuchs who observe my Sabbaths and choose what pleases me, and hold fast my covenant, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,56,5 to them I will set up in my house and within my walls a monument that is better than having sons and of daughters. I will give them an everlasting monument that will never be cut off. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,56,"6 Also foreigners who join themselves to Yahweh— to serve him, and who love the name of Yahweh, to worship him, every one who observes the Sabbath and who keeps from defiling it, and who holds fast my covenant 7 —I will bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar. For my house will be called a house of prayer for all nations, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,56,"7 —I will bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar. For my house will be called a house of prayer for all nations, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,56,"8 this is the declaration of the Lord Yahweh, who gathers the outcasts of Israel— I will still gather others in addition to them.”"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,56,"9 All you wild beasts of the field, come and devour, all you beasts in the forest! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,56,"10 All their watchmen are blind, they do not understand. They are all silent dogs who cannot bark. They dream, and lying down they love to sleep. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,56,"11 The dogs have big appetites; they can never get enough; they are shepherds without discernment; they have all turned to their own way, each one covetous for unjust gain. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,56,"12 “Come,” they say, “let us drink wine and liquor. Tomorrow will be like today, a day great beyond measure.” 57 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,57,"1 The righteous perish, but no one considers it, and the people of covenant faithfulness are gathered away, but no one understands that the righteous is gathered away from the evil. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,57,"2 He enters into peace; they rest in their beds, those who walk in their uprightness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,57,"3 But come here, you sons of the sorceress, children of the adulterer and the woman who has prostituted herself. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,57,"4 Whom are you merrily mocking? Against whom are you opening the mouth and sticking out the tongue? Are you not children of rebellion, children of deceit? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,57,"5 You heat yourselves up sleeping together under the oaks, under every green tree, you who kill your children in the dry riverbeds, under the rocky overhangs. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,57,6 Among the smooth things of the river valley are the things that have been assigned to you. They are the object of your devotion. You pour out your drink offering to them and raise up a grain offering. In these things should I take pleasure? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,57,7 You prepared your bed on a high mountain; you also went up there to offer sacrifices. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,57,"8 Behind the door and the doorposts you set up your symbols; you deserted me, made yourselves naked, and went up; you made your bed wide. You made a covenant with them; you loved their beds; you saw their private parts. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,57,9 You went to Molech with oil; you multiplied perfumes. * You send your ambassadors far away; you went down to Sheol. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,57,"10 You were tired from your long journey, but you never said, “It is hopeless.” You found life in your hand; therefore you did not weaken. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,57,"11 “Whom are you worried about? Whom do you fear so much that has caused you to act so deceitfully, so much that you would not remember me or think about me? Because I was silent for so long, you are no longer afraid of me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,57,"12 I will proclaim all your righteous acts and tell all that you have done, but they will not help you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,57,"13 When you cry out, let your collection of idols rescue you. Instead the wind will carry them all away, a breath will carry them all away. Yet he who takes refuge in me will inherit the land and will take possession of my holy mountain. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,57,"14 He will say, * 'Build, build! Clear a way! Remove all the stumbling blocks from the path of mypeople!'”"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,57,"15 For this is what the high and elevated One says, who lives eternally, whose name is holy, “I live in the exalted and holy place, with him also that is of a crushed and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble ones, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,57,"16 For I will not accuse forever, nor will I be angry forever, for then man's spirit would faint before me, the lives that I have made. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,57,"17 Because of the sin of his violent gain, I was angry, and I punished him; I hid my face and was angry, but he went backward in the way of his heart. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,57,"18 I have seen his ways, but I will heal him. I will lead him and comfort and console those who mourn for him, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,57,"19 and I create the fruit of the lips. Peace, peace, to those who are far off and to those who are near—says Yahweh—I will heal them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,57,"20 But the wicked are like the tossing sea, which cannot rest, and its waters churn up mire and mud. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,57,21 There is no peace for the wicked one—says God.” 58 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,58,"1 “Cry loudly; do not hold back. Lift up your voice like a trumpet. Confront my people with their rebellion, and the house of Jacob with their sins. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,58,"2 Yet they seek me daily and delight in the knowledge of my ways, like a nation that practiced righteousness and did not abandon the law of their God. They ask me for righteous judgments; they take pleasure in the thought of God coming near. 3 'Why have we fasted,' they say, 'but you do not see it? Why have we humbled ourselves, but you do not notice?' Look, on the day of your fast you find your own pleasure and oppress all your laborers. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,58,"3 'Why have we fasted,' they say, 'but you do not see it? Why have we humbled ourselves, but you do not notice?' Look, on the day of your fast you find your own pleasure and oppress all your laborers. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,58,"4 Look, you fast to quarrel and fight, and to hit with your fist of wickedness; you do not fast today to make your voice heard above. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,58,"5 Is this really the kind of fast that I would want A day for anybody to humble himself, for him to bow down his head like a reed, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under himself? Do you really call this a fast, a day that pleases Yahweh? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,58,"6 Is not this the fast that I choose To release wicked bonds, to undo the ropes of the yoke, to set the crushed ones free, and to break every yoke? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,58,"7 Is it not to break your bread with the hungry and to bring the poor and homeless into your house?” When you see someone naked, you should clothe him; and you should not hide yourself from your own relatives. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,58,"8 Then your light would be broken open like the sunrise, and your healing would quickly sprout up; your righteousness would go before you, and the glory of Yahweh would be your rearguard."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,58,"9 Then you would call, and Yahweh would answer; you would cry out for help, and he would say, “Here I am.” If you take away from among yourselves the yoke, the accusing finger, and the speech of wickedness, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,58,"10 if you yourselves provide for the hungry and satisfy the need of the distressed; then your light will rise in the darkness, and your darkness will be like the noonday. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,58,"11 Then Yahweh will lead you continually and satisfy you in regions where there is no water, and he will strengthen your bones. You will be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters never fail. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,58,"12 Some of you will rebuild the ancient ruins; you will raise up the ruins of many generations; you will be called “The repairer of the wall,” “The restorer of streets to live on.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,58,"13 Suppose that you turn back your feet from traveling on the Sabbath day, and from doing your own pleasure on my holy day. Suppose that you call the Sabbath a delight, and that you call the matters of Yahweh holy and honored. Suppose that you honor the Sabbath by leaving your own business, and by not finding your own pleasure and by not speaking your own words. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,58,14 “Then you will find delight in Yahweh; and I will make you ride on the heights of the earth; I will feed you from the inheritance of Jacob your father—for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken.” 59 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,59,"1 Look, Yahweh's hand is not so short that it cannot save; nor his ear so dull, that it cannot hear. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,59,"2 Your sinful acts, however, have separated you from your God, and your sins have made him hide his face from you and from hearing you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,59,3 For your hands are stained with blood and your fingers with sin. Your lips speak lies and your tongue speaks maliciously. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,59,"4 No one calls in righteousness, and none pleads his case in truth. They trust in empty words, and tell lies; they conceive trouble and give birth to sin. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,59,"5 They hatch eggs of a poisonous snake and weave a spider's web. Whoever eats of their eggs dies, and if an egg is crushed, it hatches into a poisonous snake. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,59,"6 Their webs cannot be used for garments, nor can they cover themselves with their works. Their works are works of sin, and deeds of violence are in their hands. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,59,"7 Their feet run to evil, and they run to pour out innocent blood. Their thoughts are thoughts of sin; violence and destruction are their roads. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,59,"8 The way of peace they do not know, and there is no justice in their paths. They have made crooked paths; whoever travels these paths does not know peace. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,59,"9 Therefore justice is far from us, nor does righteousness reach us. We wait for light, but see darkness; we look for brightness, but we walk in darkness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,59,"10 We grope for the wall like the blind, like those who cannot see. We stumble at noonday as in the twilight; among the strong we are like dead men. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,59,"11 We growl like bears and moan like doves; we wait for justice, but there is none; for rescue, but it is far from us."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,59,"12 For our many transgressions are before you, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and we know our sins. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,59,"13 We have rebelled, denying Yahweh and turning away from following our God. We have spoken extortion and turning aside, conceived complaining from the heart and words of lying. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,59,"14 Justice is driven back, and righteousness stands far off; for truth stumbles in the public square, and right cannot come. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,59,"15 Trustworthiness has gone away, and he who turns away from evil makes himself a victim. Yahweh saw it and was displeased that there was no justice. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,59,"16 He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no one to intervene. Therefore his own arm brought salvation for him, and his righteousness sustained him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,59,17 He put on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation upon his head. He clothed himself with garments of vengeance and wore zeal as a mantle. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,59,"18 He repaid them for what they had done, angry judgment to his adversaries, vengeance to his enemies, to the islands punishment as their reward. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,59,"19 So they will fear the name of Yahweh from the west, and his glory from the sun's rising; for he will come as a rushing stream, driven by the breath of Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,59,20 “A redeemer will come to Zion and to those who turn from their rebellious deeds in Jacob—this is Yahweh's declaration. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,59,"21 As for me, this is my covenant with them—says Yahweh—my spirit who is upon you, and my words which I have put in your mouth, will not leave your mouth, or go out of the mouth of your children, or go out of the mouth of your children's children—says Yahweh—from this time and forever.” 60 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,60,"1 Arise, shine; for your light has come, and the glory of Yahweh has risen on you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,60,"2 Though darkness will cover the earth, and thick darkness the nations; yet Yahweh will arise upon you, and his glory will be seen on you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,60,"3 Nations will come to your light, and kings to your bright light that is rising. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,60,"4 Look all around and see. They all gather themselves together and come to you. Your sons will come from far, and your daughters will be carried in their arms. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,60,"5 Then you will look and be radiant, and your heart shall rejoice and overflow, because the abundance of the sea will be poured out to you, the wealth of the nations will come to you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,60,"6 Camel caravans will cover you, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all of them will come from Sheba; they will bring gold and frankincense, and will sing the praises of Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,60,"7 All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered together to you, the rams of Nebaioth will serve your needs; they will be acceptable offerings on my altar; and I will glorify my glorious house. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,60,"8 Who are these who fly along like a cloud, and like the doves to their shelters? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,60,"9 The coastlands look for me, and the ships of Tarshish lead, to bring your sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, for the name of Yahweh your God, and for the Holy One of Israel, because he has honored you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,60,"10 Sons of foreigners will rebuild your walls, and their kings will serve you; though in my wrath I punished you, yet in my favor I will have compassion onyou."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,60,"11 Your gates also will remain open continually; they will not be shut day or night, so that the wealth of the nations may be brought, with their kings being led. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,60,"12 Indeed, nations and kingdoms that will not serve you will perish; those nations will be completely destroyed. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,60,"13 The glory of Lebanon will come to you, the cypress tree, the fir, and the cypress box tree together, to beautify my sanctuary; and I will glorify the place of my feet. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,60,"14 They will come to you to bow down, the sons of those who humbled you; they will bow at your feet; they will call you The City of Yahweh, Zion of the Holy One of Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,60,"15 Instead of you remaining abandoned and hated, with no one passing through you, I will make you a thing of pride forever, a joy from generation to generation. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,60,"16 You will also drink the milk of the nations, and will nurse at the breast of kings; you will know that I, Yahweh, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,60,"17 Instead of bronze I will bring gold, instead of iron I will bring silver; instead of wood, bronze, and instead of stones, iron. I will appoint peace as your governors, and justice your rulers. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,60,"18 Violence will no longer be heard in your land, or devastation nor shattering within your borders; but you will call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,60,"19 The sun will no longer be your light by day, nor will the brightness of the moon shine on you; but Yahweh will be your everlasting light, and your God your glory. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,60,"20 Your sun will no longer set, nor will your moon withdraw and disappear; for Yahweh will be your everlasting light, and the days of your mourning will be ended. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,60,"21 All your people will be righteous; they will take possession of the land for all time, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,60,"22 The little one shall become a thousand, and the small one a strong nation; I, Yahweh, will swiftly accomplish these things when the time comes. 61 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,61,"1 The Spirit of the Lord Yahweh is on me, because Yahweh has anointed me to proclaim good news to the afflicted. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison for those who are bound. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,61,"2 He has sent me to proclaim the year of Yahweh's favor, the day of vengeance of our God, and to comfort all who mourn. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,61,"3 He has sent me—to give to those who mourn in Zion—to give them a turban instead of ashes, oil of joy instead of mourning, a mantle of praise in place of a spirit of dullness, to call them oaks of righteousness, the planting of Yahweh, that he may be glorified. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,61,"4 They will rebuild the ancient ruins; they will restore the former desolations. They will restore the ruined cities, the desolations from many former generations."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,61,"5 Foreigners will stand and feed your flocks, and sons of foreigners will work your fields and vineyards. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,61,"6 You will be called the priests of Yahweh; they will call you servants of our God. You will eat the wealth of the nations, and you will boast in their riches. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,61,7 Instead of your shame you will have double; and instead of dishonor they will rejoice over their share. So they will have a double share of their land; everlasting joy will be theirs. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,61,"8 For I, Yahweh, love justice, and I hate robbery and violent injustice. I will faithfully repay them, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,61,"9 Their descendants will be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples. All who see them will acknowledge them, that they are the people whom Yahweh has blessed. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,61,"10 I will greatly rejoice in Yahweh; in my God I will be very glad. For he has clothed me with the garments of salvation; he has clothed me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom adorns himself with a turban, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,61,"11 For as the earth produces its sprouting plants, and as the garden makes its planting grow, so the Lord Yahweh will cause righteousness and praise to sprout up in front of all the nations. 62 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,62,"1 For Zion's sake I will not be silent, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not be quiet, until her righteousness proceeds brightly, and her salvation as a burning torch. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,62,"2 The nations will see your righteousness, and all kings your glory. You will be called by a new name that Yahweh will choose. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,62,"3 You will also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Yahweh, and a turban of kingship in the hand of your God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,62,"4 It will no more be said of you, “Abandoned”; nor of your land any longer will it be said, “Desolate.” Indeed, you will be called “My delight is in her,” and your land “Married,” for Yahweh delights in you, and your land will be married. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,62,"5 Truly, as a young man marries a young woman, so your sons will marry you, and as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, your God will rejoice over you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,62,"6 I have put watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem; they are not silent day or night. You who keep reminding Yahweh, do not pause. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,62,7 Do not allow him to rest until he reestablishes Jerusalem and makes it a praise on earth. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,62,"8 Yahweh has sworn by his right hand and by the arm of his strength, “Surely I will no longer give your grain as food for your enemies. Foreigners will not drink your new wine, for which you have worked. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,62,"9 For those who harvest the grain will eat it and praise Yahweh, and those who pick the grapes will drink the wine in the courts of my holy sanctuary.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,62,"10 Come through, come through the gates! Prepare the way for the people! Build it, build the highway! Gather out the stones! Raise up a signal flag for the nations! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,62,"11 Look, Yahweh announces to the ends of the earth, “Say to the daughter of Zion Look, your Savior is coming! See, his reward is with him, and his recompense is going before him.”"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,62,"12 They will call you, “The holy people; the redeemed of Yahweh,” and you will be called “Sought after; a city not abandoned.” 63 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,63,"1 Who is this who comes from Edom, clothed in red from Bozrah? Who is he in royal clothing, marching confidently because of his great strength? It is I, speaking righteousness and powerfully able to save. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,63,"2 Why are your clothes red, and why do they look like you have been treading grapes in a winepress? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,63,"3 I have trodden grapes in the winepress alone, and no one from the nations joined me. I trod them in my anger and trampled them in my fury. Their blood is spattered on my clothes and stained all my clothes. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,63,"4 For I looked forward to the day of vengeance, and the year for my redemption had arrived. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,63,"5 I looked, and there was no one to help. I wondered that there was none to help, but my own arm brought victory for me, and my strong anger drove me on. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,63,"6 I trampled down the peoples in my anger and made them drunk in my wrath, and I poured out their blood on the earth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,63,"7 I will tell of the acts of Yahweh's covenant faithfulness, the praiseworthy deeds of Yahweh. I will tell of all that Yahweh has done for us, and of his great goodness to the house of Israel. This compassion he has shown us because of his mercy, and with many deeds of covenant faithfulness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,63,"8 For he said, “For certain they are my people, children who are not disloyal.” He became their Savior. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,63,"9 Through all their suffering, he suffered too, and the angel from his presence saved them. In his love and mercy he saved them, and he lifted them up and carried them through all the ancient times. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,63,10 But they rebelled and grieved his Holy Spirit. So he became their enemy and fought against them. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,63,"11 His people thought about the ancient times of Moses. They said, “Where is God, who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? Where is God, who put his Holy Spirit among them? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Isaiah,63,"12 Where is God, who made his glorious power go with the right hand of Moses, and divided the water before them, to make an everlasting name for himself? "

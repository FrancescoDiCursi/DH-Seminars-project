Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon, Philemon,
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,"1 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and the brother Timothy to Philemon, our dear friend and fellow worker, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,"2 and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your home. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,3 May grace be to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,4 I always thank my God. I mention you in my prayers. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,5 I have heard of the love and the faith that you have in the Lord Jesus and for all the believers. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,6 I pray that the fellowship of your faith may be effective for the knowledge of everything good that is among us in Christ. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,"7 For I have had much joy and comfort because of your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,"8 Therefore, although I have all the boldness in Christ to command you to do what you should do, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,"9 yet because of love, I appeal to you instead—I, Paul, an old man, and now a prisoner for Christ Jesus. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,"10 I am asking you concerning my child Onesimus, whom I have fathered in my chains. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,"11 For he once was useless to you, but now he is useful both to you and to me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,"12 I have sent him back to you, he who is my very heart. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,"13 I wish I could have kept him with me, so he could serve me for you, while I am in chains for the sake of the gospel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,14 But I did not want to do anything without your consent. I did not want your good deed to be from necessity but from good will. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,"15 Perhaps for this he was separated from you for a time, so that you might have him back forever. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,"16 No longer would he be a slave, but better than a slave, a beloved brother. He is beloved especially to me, and much more so to you, in both the flesh and in the Lord. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,"17 So if you have me as a partner, receive him as me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,"18 If he has wronged you or owes you anything, charge that to me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,"19 I, Paul, write this with my own hand. I myself will pay it back—not to mention that you owe me your own self! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,"20 Yes, brother, do me a favor in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,"21 Confident about your obedience, I am writing to you. I know that you will do even more than I ask. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,"22 At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given back to you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,"23 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,"24 So do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Philemon,1,25 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.

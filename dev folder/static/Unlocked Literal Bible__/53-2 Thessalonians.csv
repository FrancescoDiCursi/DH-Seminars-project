Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians, Second Thessalonians,
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,1,"1 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,1,2 May grace be to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,1,"3 We should always give thanks to God for you, brothers. For this is appropriate, because your faith is growing more and more, and the love each of you has for one another increases. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,1,4 So we ourselves speak proudly about you among the churches of God. We talk about your patience and faith in all your persecutions. We talk about the afflictions that you endure. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,1,5 This is a sign of God's righteous judgment. The result is that you will be considered worthy of the kingdom of God for which you suffer. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,1,"6 It is righteous for God to return affliction to those who afflict you, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,1,7 and relief to you who are afflicted with us. He will do this at the appearing of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his power. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,1,8 In flaming fire he will take vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not respond to the gospel of our Lord Jesus. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,1,9 They will be punished with eternal destruction away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,1,10 He will do this when he comes on that day to be glorified by his people and to be marveled at by all those who believed. For our testimony to you was believed. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,1,11 Because of this we also pray continually for you. We pray that our God will consider you worthy of your calling. We pray that he will fulfill every desire of goodness and every work of faith with power. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,1,"12 We pray these things so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified by you. We pray that you will be glorified by him, because of the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ. 2 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,2,"1 Now about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to be with him, we ask you, brothers, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,2,"2 that you not be easily disturbed or troubled, either by a spirit, by a message, or by a letter that seems to be coming from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has already come. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,2,"3 Let no one deceive you in any way. For it will not come until after the falling away comes, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction. * "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,2,"4 This is he who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or that is worshiped. As a result, he sits in the temple of God and exhibits himself as God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,2,5 Do you not remember that when I was with you I told you these things? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,2,"6 Now you know what restrains him, so that he will be revealed only at the right time. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,2,"7 For the mystery of lawlessness is already working, only there is someone who restrains him now until he is taken out of the way. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,2,"8 Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth. The Lord will bring him to nothing by the revelation of his coming. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,2,"9 The lawless one's coming will be due to the work of Satan with all power, signs, and false wonders, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,2,"10 and with all deceit of unrighteousness. These things will be for those who are perishing, because they did not receive the love of the truth for them to be saved. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,2,11 For this reason God is sending them a work of error so that they would believe a lie. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,2,"12 The result is that they will all be judged, those who did not believe the truth but instead took pleasure in unrighteousness. *"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,2,"13 But we should always give thanks to God for you, brothers loved by the Lord. For God chose you as the firstfruits for salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief in the truth. † "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,2,"14 He called you to this through our gospel, that you might obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,2,"15 So then, brothers, stand firm and hold tightly to the traditions that you were taught, whether by word or by our letter. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,2,"16 Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,2,17 comfort and establish your hearts in every good work and word. 3 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,3,"1 Now, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may rush and be glorified, as it also is with you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,3,"2 Pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil people, for not all have faith. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,3,"3 But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,3,"4 We have confidence in the Lord about you, that you both do and will continue to do the things that we command. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,3,5 May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the endurance of Christ. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,3,"6 Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you avoid every brother who lives a lazy life and does not live according to the traditions you received from us. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,3,7 For you yourselves know it is proper for you to imitate us. We did not live among you as those who had no discipline. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,3,"8 We did not eat anyone's food without paying for it. Instead, we worked night and day in difficult labor and hardship, so we might not be a burden to any of you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,3,"9 We did this not because we have no authority. Instead, we did this in order to be an example to you, so that you may imitate us. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,3,"10 When we were with you, we commanded you, “The one who is unwilling to work must not eat.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,3,11 For we hear that some walk idly among you. They do not work but are instead meddlers. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,3,"12 Now such ones we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that they should work with quietness and eat their own food. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,3,"13 But you, brothers, do not become tired of doing what is right. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,3,"14 If anyone does not obey our word in this letter, take note of him and have no association with him, so that he may be ashamed. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,3,"15 Do not consider him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,3,16 May the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. May the Lord be with you all. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,3,"17 This is my greeting, Paul, with my own hand, which is the sign in every letter. This is how I write. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Thessalonians,3,18 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. †

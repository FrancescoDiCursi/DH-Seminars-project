Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations, Lamentations,
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,1,"1 The city that once was full of people is now sitting all alone. She has become like a widow, though she was a mighty nation. She was a princess among the nations, but is now forced into slavery. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,1,"2 She weeps and wails in the night, and her tears cover her cheeks. None of her lovers comfort her. All her friends have betrayed her. They have become her enemies. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,1,"3 After poverty and affliction, Judah has gone into exile. She lives among the nations and finds no rest. All her pursuers overtook her in her desperation. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,1,4 The roads of Zion mourn because none come to the appointed feasts. All her gates are desolate. Her priests groan. Her virgins are sorrowful and she herself is in complete distress. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,1,5 Her adversaries have become her master; her enemies prosper. Yahweh has afflicted her for her many sins. Her little children go into captivity to her adversary. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,1,"6 Beauty has left the daughter of Zion. Her princes have become like deer that cannot find pasture, and they go without strength before their pursuer. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,1,"7 In the days of her affliction and her homelessness, Jerusalem will call to mind all her precious treasures that she had in former days. When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, no one helped her. The adversaries saw her and laughed at her destruction. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,1,"8 Jerusalem sinned greatly, therefore, she has become scorned as something that is filthy. All who honored her now despise her since they have seen her nakedness. She groans and tries to turn away. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,1,"9 She has become unclean beneath her skirts. She did not think about her future. Her fall was terrible. There was no one to comfort her. She cried out, “Look at my affliction, Yahweh, for the enemy has become too great!” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,1,"10 The adversary has put his hand on all our precious treasures. She has seen the nations enter her sanctuary, even though you had commanded that they must not enter into your assembly place. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,1,"11 All her people groan as they search for bread. They have given their precious treasures for food to restore their lives. Look, Yahweh, and consider me, for I have become worthless. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,1,"12 Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Look and see if there is anyone else's sorrow like the sorrow that is being inflicted on me, since Yahweh has tormented me on the day of his fierce anger. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,1,"13 It is from on high that he has sent fire into my bones, and it has conquered them. He has spread a net for my feet and turned me back. He has made me constantly desolate and weak. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,1,"14 The yoke of my transgressions is bound together by his hand. They are knit together and placed upon my neck. He has made my strength fail. The Lord has given me over into their hands, and I am not able to stand."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,1,15 The Lord has tossed aside all my mighty men who defended me. He has called an assembly against me to crush my vigorous men. The Lord has trampled the virgin daughter of Judah in the winepress. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,1,"16 For these things I weep, my eyes overflow with tears; for a comforter is far from me, one who restores my life. My children are desolate because the enemy has conquered me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,1,17 Zion has spread her hands wide; there is none to comfort her. Yahweh has commanded that those around Jacob should be his adversaries. Jerusalem is something unclean to them. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,1,"18 Yahweh is righteous, for I have rebelled against his commandment. Hear, all you peoples, and see my sorrow. My virgins and my vigorous men have gone into captivity. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,1,"19 I called for my friends, but they were treacherous toward me. My priests and my elders perished in the city, while they sought food to restore their lives. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,1,"20 Look, Yahweh, for I am in distress; my stomach churns, my heart is disturbed within me, for I have been very rebellious. Outside, the sword bereaves a mother, inside the house there is only death. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,1,"21 They have heard my groaning, but there is no one to comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my trouble and they are glad that you have done it. You have brought the day you promised; now let them become like me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,1,22 Let all their wickedness come before you. deal with them as you have dealt with me because of all my transgressions. My groans are many and my heart is faint. 2 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,2,1 The Lord has covered the daughter of Zion under the cloud of his anger. He has thrown the splendor of Israel down from heaven to earth. He has not remembered his footstool on the day of his anger. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,2,2 The Lord has swallowed up and has had no compassion on all the towns of Jacob. In the days of his anger he has thrown down the fortified cities of the daughter of Judah; in dishonor he has brought down to the ground the kingdom and its rulers. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,2,3 With fierce anger he has cut off every horn of Israel. He has withdrawn his right hand from before the enemy. He has burned up Jacob like a blazing fire that devours everything around it. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,2,"4 Like an enemy he has bent his bow toward us, with his right is ready to shoot. He has slaughtered all who had been so pleasing to him in the tent of the daughter of Zion; he has poured out his wrath like fire. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,2,5 The Lord has become like an enemy. He has swallowed up Israel. He has swallowed up all her palaces. He has destroyed her strongholds. He has increased mourning and lamentation within the daughter of Judah. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,2,"6 He has attacked his tabernacle like a garden hut. He has destroyed the place of the solemn assembly. Yahweh has caused both solemn assembly and Sabbath to be forgotten in Zion, for he has despised both king and priest in the indignation of his anger. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,2,"7 The Lord has rejected his altar and disowned his sanctuary. He has given over the walls of her palaces into the hand of the enemy. They have raised a shout in the house of Yahweh, as on the day of an appointedfeast."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,2,8 Yahweh decided to destroy the city wall of the daughter of Zion. He has stretched out the measuring line and has not withheld his hand from destroying the wall. He has made the ramparts and wall to lament; together they wasted away. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,2,"9 Her gates have sunk into the ground; he has destroyed and broken the bars of her gate. Her king and her princes are among the nations, the law is no more and her prophets find no vision from Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,2,10 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground in silence. They have thrown dust on their heads and put on sackcloth. The virgins of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,2,"11 My eyes have failed from their tears; my stomach churns; my inner parts are poured out to the ground because of the destruction of the daughter of my people, children and infants faint in the streets of the city. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,2,"12 They say to their mothers, “Where is grain and wine?” as they faint like a wounded man in the streets of the city, their lives are poured out on the bosom of their mothers. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,2,"13 What can I say to you, daughter of Jerusalem? To what can I compare to you, that I may comfort you, virgin daughter of Zion? Your wound is as great as the sea. Who can heal you? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,2,"14 Your prophets have seen false and worthless visions for you. They have not exposed your iniquity to restore your fortunes, but for you they gave utterances that are false and misleading. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,2,"15 All those who pass along the road clap their hands at you. They hiss and shake their heads against the daughter of Jerusalem and say, “Is this the city that they called 'The Perfection of Beauty,' 'The Joy for All of Earth'?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,2,"16 All your enemies open their mouths against you. They sneer and grind their teeth in rage and say, “We have swallowed her up! This is the day we have waited for! We have lived to see it!” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,2,"17 Yahweh has done what he planned to do. He has fulfilled his word. He has overthrown you without pity, for he has permitted the enemy to rejoice over you; he has lifted up the horn of your enemies. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,2,"18 Their heart cried out to the Lord, walls of the daughter of Zion! Make your tears flow down like a river day and night. Give yourself no relief, your eyes no relief. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,2,"19 Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the night watches! Pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord. Lift up your hands to him for the lives of your children who faint with hunger at the corner of every street.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,2,"20 See, Yahweh, and consider those you have dealt in this way. Should women eat the fruit of their wombs, the children whom they have cared for? Should priest and prophet be slaughtered in the sanctuary of the Lord? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,2,21 Both the young and the old lie on the dust of the streets. My young women and my young men have fallen by the sword; you have slaughtered them without taking pity on them.
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,2,"22 You have summoned, as you would call the people to a feast day, my terrors on every side, on the day of the anger of Yahweh no one escaped or survived; those I cared for and raised, my enemy has destroyed. 3 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,1 I am a man who has seen misery under the rod of Yahweh's fury. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,2 He drove me away and caused me to walk in darkness rather than light. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"3 Surely he turned his hand against me again and again, the whole day long. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,4 He made my flesh and my skin waste away; he broke my bones. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"5 He built up siege works against me, and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"6 He made me live in dark places, like those who died long ago. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,7 He built a wall around me and I cannot escape. He made my chains heavy 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"8 and though I call out and cry for help, he shut out my prayer. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,9 He blocked my path with a wall of hewn stone; he made my paths crooked. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"10 He is like a bear waiting to ambush me, a lion in hiding; "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"11 he turned aside my paths, he has made me desolate. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,12 He bent his bow and set me as a target for his arrow. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,13 He pierced my kidneys with the arrows of his quiver. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"14 I became a laughingstock to all my people, the object of their taunting all day long. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,15 He filled me with bitterness and forced me to drink wormwood. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"16 He has made my teeth grind with gravel, and he made me cower in the ashes. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,17 My soul is deprived of peace; I have forgotten what happiness is. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"18 So I say, “My endurance has perished and so has my hope in Yahweh.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"19 Remember my affliction and my wanderings, the wormwood and bitterness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,20 I continually remember it and I am bowed down within me. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,21 But I call this to mind and therefore I have hope 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"22 The steadfast love of Yahweh never ceases and his compassions never end, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,23 they are new every morning; your faithfulness is great. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"24 “Yahweh is my inheritance,” I said, therefore I will hope in him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"25 Yahweh is good to those who wait for him, to the one who seeks him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,26 It is good to wait silently for the salvation of Yahweh. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,27 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"28 Let him sit alone in silence, when it is laid upon him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,29 Let him put his mouth in the dust—there may yet be hope. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"30 Let him offer his cheek to the one who strikes him, and let him be filled to the full with reproach. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"31 For the Lord will not reject us forever, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"32 but though he causes grief, he will have compassion according to the abundance of his steadfast love. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,33 For he does not afflict from his heart or torment the children of mankind. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"34 To crush underfoot all the prisoners of the earth, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"35 to deny a man justice in the presence of the Most High, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,36 to deny justice to a person—the Lord would not approve such things! 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"37 Who has spoken and it came to pass, unless the Lord decreed it? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,38 Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that both calamities and the good come? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,39 How can any person alive complain? How can a person complain about the punishment for his sins?
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"40 Let us examine our ways and test them, and let us return to Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,41 Let us lift up our hearts and our hands to God in the heavens 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"42 “We have transgressed and rebelled, and you have not forgiven. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"43 You have covered yourself with anger and pursued us, you have killed and you have not spared. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,44 You have covered yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can pass through. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,45 You have made us like filthy scum and refuse among the nations. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"46 All our enemies curse us, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"47 panic and pitfall have come upon us, ruin and destruction. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,48 My eyes flow with streams of tears because my people are destroyed. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"49 My eyes will shed tears without ceasing, without relief, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,50 until Yahweh from heaven looks down and sees. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,51 My eyes cause me grief because of all the daughters of my city. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,52 I have been hunted like a bird by those who were my enemies; they hunted me without a reason. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"53 They cast me into a pit and they threw a stone on me, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"54 and they caused waters to overflow, covering my head. I said, 'I have been cut off!' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"55 I called on your name, Yahweh, from the depths of the pit. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"56 You heard my voice when I said, 'Do not close your ear to my cry for help.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"57 You came near on the day I called on you; you said, 'Do not fear.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"58 Lord, you defended my case, you saved my life! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"59 Yahweh, you have seen the wrong they have done to me; judge my case. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"60 You have seen their insults, all their plots against me— "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"61 You have heard their scorn, Yahweh, and all their plans regarding me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,62 The lips and the accusations of my enemies come against me all the day. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,63 Look at how they sit and then rise up; they mock me with their songs. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"64 Pay back to them, Yahweh, according to what they have done. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,65 You will let their hearts be shameless! May your condemnation be upon them! 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,3,"66 You pursue them in anger and destroy them from under the heavens, Yahweh!” 4 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,4,1 The gold has become tarnished; how the purest gold has changed! The holy stones are scattered at the corner of every street. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,4,"2 The precious sons of Zion were worth their weight in pure gold, but now they are worth no more than clay jars, the work of the potter's hands! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,4,"3 Even the jackals offer the breast to nurse their cubs, but the daughter of my people has become cruel, like the ostriches in the desert. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,4,"4 The tongue of the nursing baby sticks to the roof of his mouth by thirst; the children ask for food, but there is none for them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,4,5 Those who used to feast on the finest food now starve in the streets. Those who were brought up wearing scarlet clothing now lie on piles of ashes. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,4,"6 The punishment of the daughter of my people is greater than that of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment and no hands were wrung for her. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,4,"7 Her leaders were purer than snow, whiter than milk; their bodies were more ruddy than coral, their form was like sapphire. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,4,8 Their appearance now is darker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled on their bones; it has become as dry as wood.
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,4,"9 Those who have been killed by the sword were happier than those killed by hunger, who wasted away, pierced by the lack of any harvest from the field. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,4,10 The hands of compassionate women have boiled their own children; they became their food during the time when the daughter of my people was being destroyed. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,4,11 Yahweh showed all his wrath; he poured out his fierce anger. He kindled a fire in Zion that consumed her foundations. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,4,"12 The kings of the earth did not believe, nor did any of the inhabitants of the world believe, that enemies or opponents could enter the gates of Jerusalem. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,4,13 This happened because of the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests who have shed the blood of the righteous in her midst. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,4,"14 They wandered, blind, through the streets. They were so defiled by that blood that no one was allowed to touch their clothes. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,4,"15 “Away! Unclean!” people cried at them. “Away! Away! Do not touch!” So they wandered about; people said among the nations, “They can stay here no longer.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,4,"16 Yahweh himself scattered them; he does not watch over them anymore. They do not honor the priests, and they did not show any favor to the elders. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,4,"17 Our eyes failed, looking in vain for help; from our watchtowers we watched for a nation that could not rescue us. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,4,"18 They followed our steps, we could not walk in our streets. Our end was near and our days were numbered, our end had come. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,4,19 Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles in the sky. They chased us to the mountains and lay in wait for us in the wilderness. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,4,"20 The breath in our nostrils—Yahweh's anointed one—he was the one who was captured in their pits; of whom it was said, “Under his shadow we will live among the nations.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,4,"21 Rejoice and be glad, daughter of Edom, you who live in the land of Uz. But to you also the cup will be passed; you will be drunk and strip yourself naked. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,4,"22 Daughter of Zion, your punishment will come to an end; he will not extend your exile. But daughter of Edom, he will punish; he will uncover your sins. 5 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,5,"1 Remember, Yahweh, what has happened to us; look and see our disgrace. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,5,2 Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers; our houses to foreigners. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,5,"3 We have become orphans, the fatherless, and our mothers are like widows. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,5,"4 We must pay silver for the water we drink, and we must pay silver to get our own wood."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,5,5 Those who are coming after us are close behind us; we are weary and we can find no rest. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,5,6 We have given ourselves to Egypt and to Assyria to get enough food. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,5,"7 Our fathers sinned, and they are no more, and we bear their iniquities. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,5,"8 Slaves rule over us, and there is no one to deliver us from their hand. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,5,"9 We get our bread only by risking our lives, because of the sword in the wilderness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,5,10 Our skin has grown as hot as an oven because of the burning heat of hunger. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,5,"11 Women are raped in Zion, and virgins in the cities of Judah. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,5,"12 Princes are hung up by their own hands, and no honor is shown to the elders. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,5,"13 Young men are forced to grind grain with a millstone, and boys stagger under heavy loads of wood. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,5,"14 The elders have left the city gate, and the young men have left their music. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,5,15 The joy of our heart has ceased and our dancing has turned into mourning. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,5,"16 The crown has fallen from our head; woe to us, for we have sinned! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,5,"17 For this our heart has become sick, for these things our eyes grow dim "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,5,"18 for Mount Zion lies desolate, with jackals prowling over it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,5,"19 But you, Yahweh, reign forever, and you will sit upon your throne from generation to generation. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,5,20 Why do you forget us forever? Why do you forsake us for so many days? 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,5,"21 Restore us to yourself, Yahweh, and we will be restored. Renew our days as they were long ago— "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Lamentations,5,22 unless you have utterly rejected us and you are angry with us beyond measure.

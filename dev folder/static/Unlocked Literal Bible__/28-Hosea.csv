Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea, Hosea,
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,1,"1 This is the word of Yahweh that came to Hosea son of Beeri in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,1,"2 When Yahweh spoke at first through Hosea, he said to him, “Go, take for yourself a wife who is a prostitute. She will have children who are the result of her prostitution. For the land is committing great prostitution by forsaking Yahweh.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,1,"3 So Hosea went and married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,1,"4 Yahweh said to Hosea, “Call his name Jezreel. For in a little while I will punish the house of Jehu for the bloodshed at Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,1,5 It will happen on the day that I break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel.” 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,1,"6 Gomer conceived again and bore a daughter. Then Yahweh said to Hosea, “Call her name Lo-Ruhamah, for I will no longer have mercy on the house of Israel, that I should forgive them at all. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,1,"7 Yet I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and I will save them by myself, Yahweh their God. I will not save them by bow, sword, battle, horses, or horsemen.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,1,"8 Now after Gomer had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived and bore another son. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,1,"9 Then Yahweh said, “Call his name Lo-Ammi, for you are not my people, and I am not your God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,1,"10 Yet the number of the people of Israel will be like the sand of the seashore, which cannot be measured or counted. It will be that where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' it will be said to them, 'You are people of the living God.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,1,"11 The people of Judah and the people of Israel will be gathered together. They will appoint one leader for themselves, and they will go up from the land, for great will be the day of Jezreel. 2 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,"1 Say to your brothers, 'My people!' and to your sisters, 'You have been shown compassion.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,"2 Bring a lawsuit against your mother, bring a lawsuit, for she is not my wife, and neither am I her husband.Let her put away her prostitution from before herself,and her acts of adultery from between her breasts."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,"3 If not, I will strip her naked and show her nakedness as on the day that she was born. I will make her like the wilderness, like a parched land, and I will make her die from thirst. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,"4 I will not have any mercy on her children, for they are children of prostitution. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,"5 For their mother has been a prostitute, and she who conceived them has acted shamefully. She said, “I will go after my lovers, for they give me my bread and water, my wool and flax, my oil and drink.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,6 Therefore I will build up a hedge to block her way with thorns. I will build up a wall against her so she cannot find her way. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,"7 She will pursue her lovers, but she will not overtake them. She will seek them, but she will not find them. Then she will say, “I will return to my first husband, for it was better for me then than it is now.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,"8 For she had not known that it was I who gave her the grain, the new wine and the oil, and who lavished on her silver and gold, which they then used for Baal. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,"9 So I will take back her grain at harvest time, and my new wine in its season. I will take back my wool and flax that were used to cover her nakedness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,"10 Then I will strip her naked in the sight of her lovers, and no one will rescue her out of my hand. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,"11 I will also cause all her celebrations to cease— her feasts, her new moon celebrations, her Sabbaths, and all her appointed festivals. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,"12 “I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, of which she has said, 'These are the wages that my lovers gave me.' I will make them a forest, and the animals of the field will eat them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,"13 I will punish her for the feast days of the Baals, when she burned incense to them, when she adorned herself with her rings and jewelry, and she went after her lovers and forgot me— this is Yahweh's declaration.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,14 So I am going to win her back. I will bring her into the wilderness and speak tenderly to her. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,"15 I will give her back her vineyards, and the Valley of Achor as a door of hope. She will answer me there as she did in the days of her youth,as in the days that she came out of the land of Egypt."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,"16 “It will be in that day—this is Yahweh's declaration— that you will call me, 'My husband,' and you will no longer call me, 'My Baal.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,17 For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth; their names will not be remembered anymore.” 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,"18 “On that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts in the fields, with the birds in the sky, and with the crawling things on the ground. I will drive away the bow, the sword, and the battle from the land, and I will make you lie down in safety. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,"19 I will promise to be your husband forever. I will promise to be your husband in righteousness, justice, covenant faithfulness, and mercy. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,"20 I will pledge myself to you in faithfulness, and you will know Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,"21 On that day, I will answer—this is Yahweh's declaration— I will answer the heavens, and they will answer the earth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,"22 The earth will answer the grain, the new wine and the oil, and they will answer Jezreel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,2,"23 I will plant her for myself in the land, and I will have mercy on Lo-Ruhamah. I will say to Lo-Ammi, 'You are Ammi Attah,' and they will say to me, 'You are my God.'” 3 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,3,"1 Yahweh said to me, “Go again, love a woman, loved by her husband, but who is an adulteress. Love her just as I, Yahweh, love the people of Israel, although they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,3,2 So I bought her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer and a lethek of barley. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,3,"3 I said to her, “You must live with me many days. You will not be a prostitute or belong to any other man. In the same way, I will be with you.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,3,"4 For the people of Israel will live for many days without a king, prince, sacrifice, stone pillar, ephod or household idols. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,3,"5 Afterward the people of Israel will return and seek Yahweh their God and David their king, and in the last days, they will come trembling before Yahweh and his goodness. 4 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,4,"1 Hear the word of Yahweh, you people of Israel. Yahweh has a lawsuit against the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truthfulness or covenantal faithfulness, no knowledge of God in the land. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,4,"2 There is cursing, lying, killing, stealing and adultery. The people have broken all bounds, and bloodshed comes after bloodshed. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,4,"3 So the land is drying up, and everyone living in it is wasting away; the beasts in the fields and the birds in the sky, even the fish in the sea, are being taken away. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,4,"4 But do not allow anyone to bring a lawsuit; do not let anyone accuse anyone else. For it is you, the priests, whom I am accusing. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,4,"5 You priests will stumble during the day; the prophets will also stumble with you by night, and I will destroy your mother. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,4,"6 My people are being destroyed because of the lack of knowledge. Because you priests have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you as priests to me. Because you have forgotten my law, although I am your God, I also will forget your children. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,4,"7 The more the priests multiplied, the more they sinned against me. They exchanged their honor for shame. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,4,8 They feed on the sin of my people; they are greedy for more of their wickedness. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,4,9 It will be the same for the people as for the priests I will punish them all for their practices; I will repay them for their deeds. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,4,"10 They will eat but not have enough; they will commit prostitution but not increase, because they have gone far away from Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,4,"11 They love sexual promiscuity, wine, and new wine, which have taken away their understanding. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,4,"12 My people consult their wooden idols, and their walking sticks give them prophecies. For a mind of promiscuity has misled them, and they have acted as prostitutes instead of being faithful to their God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,4,"13 They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains and burn incense on the hills, under oaks, poplars and terebinths, because the shade is good. So your daughters commit sexual immorality, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,4,"14 I will not punish your daughters when they choose to commit sexual immorality, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery. For the men also give themselves to the prostitutes, and they offer sacrifices so they can commit immoral acts with sacred prostitutes. So this people who does not understand will be thrown down. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,4,"15 Though you, Israel, have committed adultery, may Judah not become guilty. Do not go to Gilgal, you people; do not go up to Beth Aven, and do not swear, saying, “As Yahweh lives.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,4,"16 For Israel has behaved stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer. How can Yahweh bring them to pasture like lambs in a meadow? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,4,17 Ephraim united himself with idols; leave him alone. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,4,"18 Even when their strong drink is gone, they continue to commit adultery; her rulers dearly love their shame."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,4,19 The wind will wrap her up in its wings; and they will be ashamed because of their sacrifices. 5 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,5,"1 “Hear this, priests! Pay attention, house of Israel! Listen, house of the king! For judgment is coming against you all. You have been a snare at Mizpah and a net spread over Tabor. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,5,"2 The rebels stand deep in slaughter, but I will punish all of them. * "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,5,"3 I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me. Ephraim, now you have become like a prostitute; Israel is defiled. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,5,"4 Their deeds will not allow them to turn to God, for the mind of adultery is in them, and they do not know Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,5,5 The pride of Israel testifies against him; so Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their guilt; and Judah also will stumble with them. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,5,"6 They will go with their flocks and herds to seek Yahweh, but they will not find him, for he has withdrawn himself from them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,5,"7 They were unfaithful to Yahweh, for they have borne illegitimate children. Now the new moon festivals will devour them with their fields. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,5,"8 Blow the horn in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah. Sound a battle cry at Beth Aven 'We will follow you, Benjamin!' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,5,9 Ephraim will become a desolation on the day of punishment. Among the tribes of Israel I have declared what is certain to happen. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,5,10 The leaders of Judah are like those who move a boundary stone. I will pour my wrath on them like water. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,5,"11 Ephraim is crushed; he is crushed in judgment, because he has willingly walked after idols. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,5,"12 So I will be like a moth to Ephraim, and like rot to the house of Judah. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,5,"13 When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria, and Judah sent messengers to the great king. But he was not able to cure you people or heal your wound. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,5,"14 So I will be like a lion to Ephraim, and like a young lion to the house of Judah. * I, even I, will tear and go away;I will carry them off,and there will be no one to rescue them."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,5,"15 I will go and return to my place, until they acknowledge their guilt and seek my face, until they earnestly seek me in their distress.” 6 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,6,"1 “Come, let us return to Yahweh. For he has torn us to pieces, but he will heal us; he has injured us, but he will bandage our wounds. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,6,"2 After two days he will revive us; he will raise us up on the third day, and we will live before him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,6,"3 Let us know Yahweh; let us press on to know Yahweh. His coming out is as sure as the dawn; he will come to us like the showers, like the spring rains that water the land.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,6,"4 Ephraim, what will I do with you? Judah, what will I do with you? Your faithfulness is like a morning cloud, like the dew that goes away early. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,6,"5 So I have cut them to pieces by the prophets, I have killed them with the words of my mouth. Your decrees are like the light that shines out. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,6,"6 For I desire faithfulness and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,6,7 Like Adam they have broken the covenant; they were unfaithful to me. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,6,8 Gilead is a city of evildoers with footprints of blood. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,6,"9 As gangs of robbers wait for someone, so the priests band together to commit murder on the way to Shechem; they have committed shameful crimes. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,6,"10 In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing; Ephraim's prostitution is there, and Israel has become unclean. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,6,"11 For you also, Judah, a harvest has been appointed, when I will restore the fortunes of my people. 7 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,7,"1 Whenever I want to heal Israel, the sin of Ephraim is exposed, as well as the evil deeds of Samaria, for they practice deceit; a thief comes in, and a marauding band attacks in the street. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,7,2 They do not realize in their hearts that I remember all their evil deeds. Now their deeds surround them; they are before my face. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,7,"3 With their evil they make the king glad, and by their lies the officials."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,7,"4 They are all adulterers, like an oven heated by the baker, who ceases to stir the fire from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,7,5 On the day of our king the officials made themselves sick with the heat of wine. He reached out with his hand to those who were mocking. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,7,"6 For with hearts like an oven, they devise their deceitful plans. Their anger smolders all night; in the morning it burns high like a flaming fire. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,7,"7 They all are as hot as an oven, and they devour those who rule over them. All their kings have fallen; none of them calls on me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,7,8 Ephraim mixes himself among the peoples. Ephraim is a flat cake that has not been turned over. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,7,"9 Foreigners have devoured his strength, but he does not know it. Gray hairs are sprinkled on him, but he does not know it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,7,"10 The pride of Israel testifies against him; however, they have not returned to Yahweh their God, nor have they sought him, in spite of all this. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,7,"11 Ephraim is like a dove, gullible and without sense, calling out to Egypt, then flying to Assyria. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,7,"12 When they go, I will spread my net over them, I will bring them down like the birds of the sky. I will punish them in their flocking together. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,7,"13 Woe to them! For they have strayed from me. Devastation is coming to them! They have rebelled against me! I would have rescued them, but they spoke lies against me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,7,"14 They have not cried to me with all their heart, but they wail on their beds. They gather together for grain and new wine, and they turn away from me. * "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,7,"15 Though I trained them and strengthened their arms, they are now plotting evil against me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,7,"16 They return, but they do not return to me, the Most High. They are like a slack bow. Their officials will fall by the sword because of the insolence of their tongues. This will become their mockery in the land of Egypt. *"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,8,1 “Place a trumpet at your lips! An eagle is coming over the house of Yahweh because the people have broken my covenant and rebelled against my law. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,8,"2 They cry out to me, 'My God, we in Israel know you.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,8,"3 But Israel has rejected what is good, and the enemy will pursue him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,8,"4 They have set up kings, but not by me. They have made princes, but without my knowledge. With their silver and gold they have made idols for themselves, but it was only so they might be cut off.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,8,"5 “Your calf has been rejected, Samaria. My anger is burning against these people. For how long will they stay guilty? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,8,6 For this idol came from Israel; a workman made it; it is not God! The calf of Samaria will be broken to pieces. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,8,"7 For the people sow the wind and reap the whirlwind. The standing grain has no heads; it yields no flour. If it does come to maturity, foreigners will devour it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,8,8 Israel is swallowed up; now they lie among the nations like something useless. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,8,9 For they went up to Assyria like a wild donkey all alone. Ephraim has hired lovers for herself. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,8,"10 Even though they have hired lovers among the nations, I will now gather them together. They will begin to waste away because of the oppression of the king of princes. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,8,"11 For Ephraim has multiplied altars for sin offerings, but they have become altars for committing sins instead. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,8,"12 I could write down my law for them ten thousand times, but they would view it as something strange to them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,8,"13 As for the sacrifices of my offerings, they sacrifice meat and eat it, but I, Yahweh, do not accept them. Now I will think about their iniquity and punish their sins. They will return to Egypt. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,8,"14 Israel has forgotten me, his Maker, and has built palaces. Judah has fortified many cities, but I will send fire on his cities;it will destroy his fortresses."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,9,"1 Do not rejoice, Israel, with joy like the other peoples. For you have been unfaithful, forsaking your God. You love to pay the wages a prostitute requires on all the threshing floors. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,9,2 But the threshing floor and the winepress will not feed them; the new wine will fail them. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,9,"3 They will not continue to live in Yahweh's land; instead, Ephraim will return to Egypt, and one day they will eat unclean food in Assyria. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,9,"4 They will pour out no wine offerings to Yahweh, neither will they be pleasing to him. Their sacrifices will be to them like mourners' food all who eat it will be defiled. For their food will be for themselves only; it will not come into the house of Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,9,"5 What will you do on the day of an appointed festival, on the day of a festival for Yahweh? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,9,"6 For, look, if they escape from destruction, Egypt will gather them, and Memphis will bury them. As for their treasures of silver— sharp briers will possess them, and thorns will fill their tents. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,9,"7 The days for punishment are coming; the days for retribution are coming. Let all Israel know these things. The prophet is a fool, and the inspired man is insane, because of your great iniquity and great hostility. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,9,"8 The prophet is the watchman for my God over Ephraim. But a bird snare is on all of his paths, and hostility toward him is in the house of his God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,9,"9 They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah. God will call to mind their iniquity, and he will punish their sins. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,9,"10 Yahweh says, “When I found Israel, it was like finding grapes in the wilderness. Like the very first fruit of the season on the fig tree, I found your fathers. But they went to Baal Peor, and they devoted themselves to that shameful idol. They became as detestable as the idol they loved. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,9,"11 As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird. There will be no birth, no pregnancy, and no conception. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,9,"12 Though they have brought up children, I will take them away so that none of them is left. Woe to them when I turn away from them!"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,9,"13 I have seen Ephraim, just like Tyre, planted in a meadow, but Ephraim will bring out his children to someone who will slaughter them.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,9,"14 Give them, Yahweh—what will you give them? Give them a miscarrying womb and breasts that give no milk. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,9,"15 “Because of all their wickedness in Gilgal, that is where I began to hate them. Because of their sinful deeds, I will drive them out of my house. I will love them no more; all their officials are rebels. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,9,"16 Ephraim is diseased, and their root is dried up; they bear no fruit. Even if they have children, I will put their beloved children to death.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,9,17 My God will reject them because they have not obeyed him. They will become wanderers among the nations. 10 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,10,"1 Israel is a luxuriant vine that produces his fruit. As his fruit increased, the more altars he built. As his land produced more, he improved his pillars. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,10,2 Their heart is deceitful; now they must bear their guilt. Yahweh will demolish their altars; he will destroy their pillars. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,10,"3 For then they will say, “We have no king, for we did not fear Yahweh, and a king—what could he do for us?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,10,4 They speak empty words and make covenants by swearing falsely. So justice springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a field. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,10,"5 The inhabitants of Samaria will be afraid because of the calves of Beth Aven. Its people mourned over them, as did those idolatrous priests who had rejoiced over them and their splendor, but they are no longer there. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,10,"6 They will be carried to Assyria as a present for the great king. Ephraim will be disgraced, and Israel will be ashamed of its idol. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,10,"7 Samaria's king will be destroyed, like a chip of wood on the surface of the water. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,10,"8 The high places of wickedness will be destroyed. This is the sin of Israel! Thorns and thistles will grow over their altars.The people will say to the mountains, “Cover us!”and to the hills, “Fall on us!”"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,10,"9 “Israel, you have sinned since the days of Gibeah; there you have remained. Will not war overtake the sons of wrong in Gibeah? "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,10,"10 When I desire it, I will discipline them. The nations will gather together against them and put them in bonds for their double iniquity. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,10,"11 Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh the grain, so I will put a yoke on her fair neck. I will put a yoke on Ephraim; Judah will plow; Jacob will pull the harrow by himself. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,10,"12 Sow righteousness for yourselves, and reap the fruit of covenant faithfulness. Break up your unplowed ground, for it is time to seek Yahweh, until he comes and rains righteousness on you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,10,13 You have plowed wickedness; you reaped injustice. You have eaten the fruit of deception because you trusted in your plans and in your many soldiers. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,10,"14 So a tumult of war will rise among your people, and all your fortified cities will be destroyed. It will be as Shalman destroyed Beth Arbel on a day of battle, when mothers were dashed to pieces with their children. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,10,"15 So it will happen to you, Bethel, because of your great wickedness. At daybreak the king of Israel will be completely cut off.” 11 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,11,"1 “When Israel was a young man I loved him, and I called my son out of Egypt. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,11,"2 The more they were called, the more they went away from me. They sacrificed to the Baals and burned incense to idols. * "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,11,"3 Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk. It was I who lifted them up by their arms, but they did not know that I cared for them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,11,"4 I led them with cords of humanity, with bands of love. I was to them like someone who eased the yoke on their jaws, and I bent down to them and fed them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,11,5 Will they not return to the land of Egypt? Will Assyria not rule over them because they refuse to return to me? *
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,11,6 The sword will fall on their cities and destroy the bars of their gates; it will destroy them because of their own plans. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,11,"7 My people are determined to turn away from me. Though they call to the Most High, no one will help them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,11,"8 How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboyim? My heart has changed within me; all my compassions have been stirred up. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,11,"9 I will not execute my fierce anger; I will not again destroy Ephraim. For I am God and not a man; I am the Holy One among you, and I will not come in wrath. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,11,"10 They will follow Yahweh; and he will roar like a lion. When he roars, his children will come trembling from the west. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,11,"11 They will come trembling like a bird from Egypt, like a dove from the land of Assyria. I will make them live in their homes—this is the declaration of Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,11,"12 Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit. But Judah is still going about with me, God, and is faithful to me, the Holy One.” 12 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,12,1 Ephraim feeds on the wind and follows after the east wind. He continually multiplies lies and violence. They make a covenant with Assyria and carry olive oil to Egypt. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,12,2 Yahweh also has a lawsuit against Judah and will punish Jacob for what he has done; he will repay him for his deeds. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,12,"3 In the womb Jacob grasped his brother by the heel, and in his manhood he struggled with God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,12,4 He struggled with the angel and won. He wept and begged for his favor. He met God at Bethel; there God spoke with him. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,12,"5 This is Yahweh, the God of hosts; “Yahweh” is his name to be called on. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,12,"6 So turn to your God. Keep covenantal faithfulness and justice, and wait continually for your God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,12,7 The merchants have false scales in their hands; they love to defraud.
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,12,"8 Ephraim said, “I have certainly become very rich; I have found wealth for myself. In all my work they will not find any iniquity in me, anything that would be sin.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,12,"9 “I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt. I will again make you live in tents, as in the days of the appointed festival. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,12,"10 I spoke to the prophets, and I gave them many visions for you. By the hand of the prophets I gave parables.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,12,"11 If there is wickedness in Gilead, surely the people are worthless. In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls; their altars will be like heaps of stone in the furrows of the fields. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,12,12 Jacob fled to the land of Aram; Israel worked in order to get a wife; and he kept flocks of sheep to get a wife. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,12,"13 Yahweh brought Israel out of Egypt by a prophet, and by a prophet he took care of them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,12,14 Ephraim has bitterly angered Yahweh. So his Lord will leave his blood on him and will turn back on him his disgrace. 13 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,13,"1 “When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling. He exalted himself in Israel, but he became guilty because of Baal worship, and he died. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,13,"2 Now they sin more and more. They make cast metal figures from their silver, idols as skillfully worked as possible, all of them the work of the craftsmen. People say of them, 'These men who sacrifice kiss calves.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,13,"3 So they will be like the morning clouds, like the dew that goes away early, like the chaff that is driven by the wind away from a threshing floor, and like smoke out of a chimney. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,13,"4 But I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt. You must acknowledge no God but me; you must acknowledge that besides me, there is no other savior. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,13,"5 I knew you in the wilderness, in the land of great dryness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,13,"6 When you had pasture, then you became full; and when you were filled, your heart became lifted up. For that reason you forgot me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,Hosea,13,7 I will become like a lion to them; like a leopard I will watch along the path.

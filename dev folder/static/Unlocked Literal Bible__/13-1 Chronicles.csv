Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,10,1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel. Every man of Israel fled from before the Philistines and fell down dead on Mount Gilboa. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,10,"2 The Philistines closely pursued Saul and his son. The Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malki- Shua, his sons. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,10,"3 The battle went heavily against Saul, and the archers overtook him, and they wounded him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,10,"4 Then said Saul to his armor bearer, “Draw your sword and thrust me through with it. Otherwise, these uncircumcised will come and abuse me.” But his armor bearer would not, for he was very afraid. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,10,"5 When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword and died. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,10,"6 So Saul died, and his three sons, so all his household members died together. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,10,"7 When every man of Israel in the valley saw that they had fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled. Then the Philistines came and lived in them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,10,"8 It came about on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,10,9 They stripped him and took his head and his armor. They sent messengers throughout Philistia to carry the news to their idols and to the people. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,10,"10 They put his armor in the temple of their gods, and fastened his head to the temple of Dagon. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,10,"11 When all Jabesh Gilead heard of all that the Philistines had done to Saul, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,10,"12 all the fighting men went and took away the body of Saul and those of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh. They buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh and fasted seven days. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,10,"13 So Saul died because he was unfaithful to Yahweh. He did not obey Yahweh's instructions, but asked for advice from someone who talked with the dead. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,10,"14 He did not seek guidance from Yahweh, so Yahweh killed him and turned over the kingdom to David son of Jesse. 11 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,"1 Then all Israel came to David at Hebron and said, “Look, we are your flesh and bone. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,"2 In the recent past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led the Israelite army. Yahweh your God said to you, 'You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become a ruler over my people Israel.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,"3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them before Yahweh. They anointed David king over Israel. In this way, the word of Yahweh that had been declared by Samuel came true. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,"4 David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). Now the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,"5 The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You will not come in here.” But David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,"6 David had said, “Whoever attacks the Jebusites first will become chief and commander.” So Joab son of Zeruiah attacked first, so he was made the chief. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,7 Then David began to live in the stronghold. So they called it the city of David. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,8 He built the city all around from the Millo and back to the surrounding wall. Joab restored the rest of the city. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,9 David became greater and greater because Yahweh of hosts was with him.
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,"10 These were the leaders David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, obeying the word of Yahweh concerning Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,"11 This is a list of David's mighty men Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, was commander of the officers *. He killed three hundred men with his spear on one occasion. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,"12 After him was Eleazar son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,"13 He was with David at Pas Dammim, and there the Philistines assembled together for battle, where there was a barley field and the army fled from the Philistines. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,14 They stood in the middle of the field. They defended it and cut down the Philistines and Yahweh rescued them with a great victory. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,"15 Then three of the thirty leaders went down to the rock to David, to the cave of Adullam. The army of the Philistines was camped in the Valley of Rephaim. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,"16 At that time David was in his stronghold, a cave, while the Philistines had established their camp at Bethlehem. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,"17 David was longing for water and said, “If only someone would give me water to drink from the well at Bethlehem, the well that is by the gate!” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,"18 So these three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, the well at the gate. They took the water and brought it to David, but he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out to Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,"19 Then he said, “May it be that I should never do this! Should I drink the blood of these men who have risked their lives?” Because they had put their lives at risk, David refused to drink it. These were the deeds of the three mighty men. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,20 Abishai brother of Joab was captain over the Three. He once used his spear against three hundred and killed them. He is mentioned along with the Three. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,"21 Of the Three, he was given double honor and became their captain, even though he was not one of them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,"22 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a brave warrior from Kabzeel, who did great deeds. He killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down into a pit and killed a lion on a day when the snow was falling. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,"23 He even killed an Egyptian, a man five cubits tall. The Egyptian had a spear like a weaver's beam, but he went down to him with only a staff. He seized the spear out of the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,"24 Benaiah son of Jehoiada did these feats, and he was named alongside the three mighty men. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,11,"25 He was more highly regarded than the thirty soldiers in general, but he was not regarded quite as highly as the three mighty men. Yet David put him in charge of his bodyguard. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,12,"15 They crossed the Jordan in the first month, when it overflowed its banks, and chased away all those living in the valleys, both toward the east and toward the west. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,12,16 Some of the men of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,12,"17 David went out to meet them and addressed them “If you have come in peace to me to help me, you may join me. But if you have come to betray me to my adversaries, may the God of our ancestors see and rebuke you, since I have done no wrong.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,12,"18 Then the Spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the thirty. Amasai said, “We are yours, David. We are on your side, son of Jesse. Peace, may peace be to whoever helps you. May peace be to your helpers, for your God is helping you.” Then David received them and made them commanders over his men. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,12,"19 Some from Manasseh also deserted to David when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle. Yet they did not help the Philistines, because the Philistine lords consulted with each other and sent David away. They said, “He will desert to his master Saul at the risk of our lives.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,12,"20 When he went to Ziklag, the men of Manasseh who joined him were Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, captains over thousands of Manasseh. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,12,"38 All these soldiers, equipped for battle, came to Hebron with firm intentions to make David king over all Israel. All the rest of Israel were in agreement to make David king also. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,12,"39 They were there with David three days, eating and drinking, for their relatives had sent them with provisions. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,12,"40 In addition, those who were near to them, as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen, and cakes of figs, clusters of raisins, wine, oil, oxen, and sheep, for Israel was celebrating. 13 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,13,"1 David consulted with the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, with every leader. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,13,"2 David said to all the assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and if this comes from Yahweh our God, let us send messengers everywhere to our brothers who remain in all the regions of Israel, and to the priests and Levites who are in their cities. Let them be told to join us. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,13,"3 Let us bring the ark of our God back to ourselves, for we did not seek his will in the days of Saul's reign.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,13,"4 The whole assembly agreed to do these things, because they seemed right in the eyes of all the people. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,13,"5 So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor River in Egypt to Lebo Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,13,"6 David and all Israel went up to Baalah, that is, Kiriath Jearim, which belongs to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by Yahweh's name, Yahweh, who sits enthroned over the cherubim. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,13,7 So they set the ark of God on a new cart. They brought it out of Abinadab's house. Uzzah and Ahio were guiding the cart. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,13,"8 David and all Israel were celebrating before God with all their might. They were singing with stringed instruments, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,13,"9 When they came to the threshing floor of Kidon, Uzzah reached out with his hand to grab the ark, because the oxen stumbled. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,13,"10 Then the anger of Yahweh burned against Uzzah, and Yahweh killed him because Uzzah had reached out with his hand to the ark. He died there before God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,13,11 David was angry because Yahweh had attacked Uzzah. That place is called Perez Uzzah to this day. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,13,"12 David was afraid of God that day. He said, “How can I bring the ark of God home to me?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,13,"13 So David did not move the ark to the city of David, but put it aside in the house of Obed Edom the Gittite. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,13,14 The ark of God remained in Obed Edom's household in his house for three months. So Yahweh blessed his house and all that he possessed. 14 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,14,"1 Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, carpenters, and masons. They built a house for him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,14,"2 David knew that Yahweh had established him as king over Israel, and that his kingdom was exalted on high for the sake of his people Israel. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,14,9 Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the Valley of Rephaim. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,14,"10 Then David asked for help from God. He said, “Should I attack the Philistines? Will you give victory over them?” Yahweh said to him, “Attack, for I will certainly give them to you.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,14,"11 So they came up to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He commented, “God has burst through my enemies by my hand like a bursting flood of water.” So the name of that place became Baal Perazim. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,14,"12 The Philistines abandoned their gods there, and David gave an order that they should be burned. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,14,13 Then the Philistines raided the valley yet again. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,14,"14 So David asked for help from God again. God said to him, “You must not attack their front, but rather circle around behind them and come on them through the balsam woods. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,14,"15 When you hear the sound of marching in the wind blowing through the balsam treetops, then attack with force. Do this because God will have gone out before you to attack the army of the Philistines.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,14,16 So David did as God had commanded him. He defeated the army of the Philistines from Gibeon all the way to Gezer. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,14,"17 Then David's fame went out into all lands, and Yahweh caused all nations to fear him. 15 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,15,1 David built houses for himself in the city of David. He prepared a place for the ark of God and set up a tent for it. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,15,"2 Then David said, “Only the Levites may carry the ark of God, for they had been chosen by Yahweh to carry the ark of Yahweh, and to serve him forever.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,15,"3 Then David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Yahweh to the place he had prepared for it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,15,4 David gathered together Aaron's descendants and the Levites. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,15,"5 From the descendants of Kohath, there was Uriel the leader and his relatives,  120 men. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,15,"11 David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,15,"12 He said to them, “You are the leaders of the Levite families. Consecrate yourselves, both you and your brothers, so that you may bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel, to the place that I have prepared for it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,15,"13 You did not carry it the first time. That is why Yahweh our God broke out against us, for we did not seek him or obey his decree.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,15,"14 So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves so they could bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,15,"15 So the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles, as Moses had commanded—following the rules given by the word of Yahweh."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,15,"16 David spoke to the leaders of the Levites to assign their brothers to be musicians with musical instruments, stringed instruments, harps and cymbals, playing loudly and joyfully lifting up their voices. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,15,"17 So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel and one of his brothers, Asaph son of Berechiah. They also ap- pointed kinsmen from Merari's descendants and Ethan son of Kushaiah. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,15,"18 With them were their kinsmen of second rank Zechariah, * Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed Edom, and Jeiel, the gatekeepers. "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,15,"22 Kenaniah, leader of the Levites, was the director of the singing because he was a teacher of music. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,15,23 Berechiah and Elkanah were guards for the ark. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,15,"24 Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed Edom and Jehiah were guards for the ark. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,15,"25 So David, the elders of Israel, and the commanders over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of Obed Edom's house with rejoicing. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,15,"26 While God helped the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,15,"27 David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were the Levites who carried the ark, the singers, and Kenaniah, the leader of the song with the singers. David was wearing a linen ephod. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,15,"28 So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh with joyful shouting, and with the sound of horns and trumpets, with cymbals, and with stringed instruments and harps. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,15,"29 But as the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came to the city of David, Michal daughter of Saul, looked out the window. She saw King David dancing and celebrating. Then she despised him in her heart. 16 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,1 They brought in the ark of God and put it in the middle of the tent that David had set up for it. Then they offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before God. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"2 When David had finished sacrificing the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"3 He distributed to every Israelite, both to men and women, a loaf of bread, and a piece of meat, and a cake of raisins. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"4 David appointed certain Levites to serve before the ark of Yahweh, and to celebrate, thank and praise Yahweh, the God of Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"5 These Levites were Asaph the leader, and second to him Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed Edom, and Jeiel. These were to play with stringed instruments and with harps. Asaph was to sound the cymbals, sounding loudly. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"6 Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests were to blow the trumpets regularly, before the ark of the covenant of God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,7 Then on that day David first appointed Asaph and his brothers to sing this song of thanksgiving to Yahweh.

Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"17 This is what he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, and to Israel as an everlasting covenant. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"18 He said, “I will give you the land of Canaan as your share of your inheritance.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"19 When they were only few in number, so very few, and they were strangers in the land, "

Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"25 For Yahweh is great and is to be praised greatly, and he is to be feared above all other gods. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"26 For all the gods of the nations are idols, but it is Yahweh who made the heavens. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,27 Splendor and majesty are in his presence. Strength and joy are in his place. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"28 Ascribe to Yahweh, you clans of peoples, ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,29 Ascribe to Yahweh the glory his name deserves. Bring an offering and come before him. Bow down to Yahweh in the splendor of holiness. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"30 Tremble before him, all the earth. The world also is established; it cannot be shaken. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"31 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let them say among the nations, “Yahweh reigns.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"32 Let the sea roar, and that which fills it shout with joy. Let the fields be joyful, and all that is in them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"33 Then let the trees in the forest shout for joy before Yahweh, for he is coming to judge the earth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"34 Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his covenant faithfulness endures forever. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"35 Then say, “Save us, God of our salvation. Gather us together and rescue us from the other nations,so that we may give thanks to your holy nameand glory in your praises.”"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"36 May Yahweh, the God of Israel, be praised from everlasting to everlasting. All the people said, “Amen” and praised Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"37 So David left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, to serve continually before the ark, as every day's work required. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"38 Obed Edom with those sixty-eight relatives were included. Obed Edom son of Jeduthun, along with Hosah, were to be gatekeepers. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,39 Zadok the priest and his fellow priests were to serve before the tabernacle of Yahweh at the high place in Gibeon. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"40 They were to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar for burnt offerings continually morning and evening, according to all that is written in the law of Yahweh, which he gave as a command to Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"41 Heman and Jeduthun were with them, together with the rest who were chosen by name, to give thanks to Yahweh, because his covenant faithfulness endures forever. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"42 Heman and Jeduthun were in charge of those who played trumpets, cymbals, and the other instruments for the sacred music. The sons of Jeduthun guarded the gate. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,16,"43 Then all the people returned to their homes, and David returned to bless his own household. 17 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"1 It happened that after the king had settled in his house, he said to Nathan the prophet, “Look, I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Yahweh is staying under a tent.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"2 Then Nathan said to David, “Go, do what is in your heart, for God is with you.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"3 But that same night the word of God came to Nathan, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"4 “Go and tell David my servant, 'This is what Yahweh says You will not build me a house in which to live. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"5 For I have not lived in a house from the day that I brought up Israel to this present day. Instead, I have been living in a tent, a tabernacle, in various places. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"6 In all places I have moved among all Israel, did I ever say anything to any of Israel's leaders whom I appointed to shepherd my people, saying, “Why have you not built me a house of cedar?”'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"7 “Now then, tell my servant David, 'This is what Yahweh of hosts says I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, so that you would be ruler over my people Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"8 I have been with you wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you, and I will make you a name, like the name of the great ones who are on the earth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"9 I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them there, so that they may live in their own place and be troubled no more. No longer will wicked people oppress them, as they did before, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"10 as they were doing from the days that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Then I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that I, Yahweh, will build you a house. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"11 It will come about that when your days are fulfilled for you to go to your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after you, and for one of your own descendants, I will establish his kingdom. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"12 He will build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"13 I will be a father to him, and he will be my son. I will not take my covenant faithfulness away from him, as I took it from Saul, who ruled before you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"14 I will set him over my house and in my kingdom forever, and his throne will be established forever.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"15 Nathan spoke to David and reported to him all these words, and he told him about the entire vision. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"16 Then David the king went in and sat before Yahweh; he said, “Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my family, that you have brought me to this point?"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"17 For this was a small thing in your sight, God. You have spoken of your servant's family for a great while to come, and have shown me future generations, Yahweh God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"18 What more can I, David, say to you? You have honored your servant. You have given your servant special recognition. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"19 Yahweh, for your servant's sake, and to fulfill your own purpose, you have done this great thing to reveal all your great deeds. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"20 Yahweh, there is none like you, and there is no God besides you, just as we have always heard. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"21 For what nation on earth is like your people Israel, whom you, God, rescued from Egypt as a people for yourself, to make a name for yourself by great and awesome deeds? You drove out nations from before your people, whom you rescued from Egypt. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"22 You made Israel your own people forever, and you, Yahweh, became their God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"23 So now, Yahweh, may the promise that you made concerning your servant and his family be established forever. Do as you have spoken. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"24 May your name be established forever and be great, so the people will say, 'Yahweh of hosts is the God of Israel,' while the house of me, David, your servant is established before you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"25 For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. That is why I, your servant, have found courage to pray to you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"26 Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have made this good promise to your servant "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,17,"27 Now it has pleased you to bless your servant's house, that it may continue forever before you. You, Yahweh, have blessed it, and it will be blessed forever.” 18 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,18,1 After this it came about that David attacked the Philistines and defeated them. He took Gath and its villages out of the Philistines' control. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,18,"2 Then he defeated Moab, and the Moabites became servants to David and paid him tribute. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,18,"3 David then defeated Hadadezer, king of Zobah at Hamath, as Hadadezer was traveling to establish his rule by the Euphrates River. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,18,"4 David captured from him a thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen. David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved enough of them for a hundred chariots. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,18,"5 When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David killed twenty-two thousand Aramean men. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,18,"6 Then David put garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans became servants to him and brought him tribute. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,18,7 David took the golden shields that were on Hadadezer's servants and brought them to Jerusalem. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,18,"8 From Tebah and Kun, cities of Hadadezer, David took very much bronze. It was with this bronze that Solomon later made the bronze basin called “The Sea,” the pillars, and the bronze equipment. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,18,"9 When Tou, king of Hamath, heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,18,"10 and so Tou sent Hadoram his son to King David to greet him and to bless him. He did this because David had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him, and because Tou had often been at war with Hadadezer. Tou also sent David many different sorts of articles made of gold and silver and bronze. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,18,"11 King David set these objects apart to Yahweh, together with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations Edom, Moab, the people of Ammon, the Philistines, and Amalek. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,18,12 Abishai son of Zeruiah killed eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,18,"13 He placed garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David's servants. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,18,"14 David reigned over all Israel, and he administered justice and righteousness to all his people. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,18,"15 Joab son of Zeruiah was the commander of the army, and Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,18,"16 Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests, and Shavsha was scribe. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,18,"17 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites, and David's sons were the chief officials at the hand of the king. 19 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,19,"1 It came about later that Nahash, king of the people of Ammon, died, and that his son became king in his place. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,19,"2 David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. David's servants entered the land of the Ammonites and went to Hanun, in order to console him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,19,"3 But the Ammonite princes said to Hanun, “Do you think that David is honoring your father because he has sent men to comfort you? Do not his servants come to you to explore and examine the land in order to overthrow it?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,19,"4 So Hanun seized David's servants, shaved them, cut off their garments to the waist, up to their buttocks, and sent them away. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,19,"5 When they explained this to David, he sent to meet with them, for the men were deeply ashamed. The king said, “Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown back, and then return.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,19,"6 When the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire Aramean chariots and horsemen from Naharaim, Maacah, and Zobah. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,19,"7 They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and the king of Maacah and his army, who came and encamped before Medeba. Then the Ammonites gathered themselves together from their cities and came out to battle. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,19,"8 When David heard of it, he sent Joab and his entire army to meet them. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,19,"9 The people of Ammon came out and lined up for battle at the city gate, while the kings who had come were by themselves in the field. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,19,"10 When Joab saw the battle lines facing him both in front and behind, he chose some of Israel's best fighters and arranged them against the Arameans. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,19,"11 As for the rest of the army, he gave it into the command of Abishai his brother, and he put them into battle lines against the army of Ammon. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,19,"12 Joab said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you, Abishai, must rescue me. But if the army of Ammon is too strong for you, then I will come and rescue you. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,19,"13 Be strong, and let us show ourselves to be strong for our people and for the cities of our God, for Yahweh will do what is good in his eyes.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,19,"14 So Joab and the soldiers of his army advanced to the battle against the Arameans, who were forced to flee before the army of Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,19,"15 When the army of Ammon saw that the Arameans had fled, they also fled from Joab's brother Abishai and went back into the city. Then Joab returned from the people of Ammon and went back to Jerusalem. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,19,"16 When the Arameans saw that they were being defeated by Israel, they sent for reinforcements from beyond the Euphrates River, with Shophak the commander of Hadadezer's army. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,19,"17 When David was told this, he gathered all Israel together, crossed the Jordan, and came upon them. He arranged the army for battle against the Arameans, and they fought him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,19,"18 The Arameans fled from Israel, and David killed seven thousand Aramean charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers. He also killed Shophak, the commander of the army. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,19,"19 When all the kings who were servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and served them. So the people of Aram were no longer willing to help the Ammonites."
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,20,"1 It came about in the springtime, at the time when kings normally go to war, that Joab led the army into battle and devastated the land of the Ammonites. He went and besieged Rabbah. David remained in Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah and defeated it. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,20,"2 David took the crown of their king from off his head, and he found that it weighed a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones. The crown was set on David's head, and he brought out the plunder of the city in large quantities. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,20,3 He brought out the people who were in the city and forced them to work with saws and iron picks and axes. David required all the cities of the people of Ammon to do this labor. Then David and all the army returned to Jerusalem. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,20,"4 It came about after this that there was a battle at Gezer with the Philistines. Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the Rephaim, and the Philistines were subdued. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,20,"5 It came about again in a battle with the Philistines at Gob, that Elhanan son of Jair the Bethlehemite killed Lahmi brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,20,6 It came about in another battle at Gath that there was a man of great height who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. He also was descended from the Rephaim. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,20,"7 When he mocked the army of Israel, Jehonadab son of Shimea, David's brother, killed him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,20,"8 These were descendants of the Rephaim of Gath, and they were killed by the hand of David and by the hand of his soldiers. 21 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,1 An adversary arose against Israel and incited David to count Israel. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"2 David said to Joab and to the commanders of the army, “Go, count the people of Israel from Beersheba to Dan and report back to me, that I may know their number.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"3 Joab said, “May Yahweh make his army a hundred times greater than it is. But my master the king, do they not all serve my master? Why does my master want this? Why bring guilt on Israel?” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,4 But the king's word was enforced against Joab. So Joab left and went throughout all Israel. Then he came back to Jerusalem. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"5 Then Joab reported the total of the count of the fighting men to David. There were in Israel 1,100, 000 men who drew the sword. Judah alone had 470,"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,000 soldiers. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"6 But Levi and Benjamin were not counted among them, for the king's command had disgusted Joab. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"7 God was offended by this action, so he attacked Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"8 David said to God, “I have greatly sinned by doing this. Now take away your servant's guilt, for I have acted very foolishly.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"9 Yahweh told Gad, David's prophet, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"10 “Go say to David, 'This is what Yahweh says I am giving you three choices. Choose one of them.'” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"11 So Gad went to David and said to him, “Yahweh says this, 'Choose one of these "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"12 either three years of famine, three months being pursued by your enemies and being caught by their swords, or else three days of Yahweh's sword, that is, a plague in the land, with the angel of Yahweh destroying throughout all the land of Israel.' Now then, decide what answer I should take to the one who sent me.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"13 Then David said to Gad, “I am in great distress! Let me fall into the hand of Yahweh rather than into the hand of man, for his merciful actions are very great.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"14 So Yahweh sent a plague on Israel, and seventy thousand people died. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"15 God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy it, Yahweh watched and changed his mind about the harm. He said to the destroying angel, “Enough! Now draw back your hand.” At that time the angel of Yahweh was standing at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"16 David looked up and saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand raised over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, layfacedown on the ground. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"17 David said to God, “Is it not I that commanded that the army be numbered? I did this wicked thing. But these sheep, what have they done? Yahweh my God! Let your hand strike me and my family, but do not let the plague remain on your people.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"18 So the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up and build an altar for Yahweh at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,19 So David went up as Gad instructed him to do in the name of Yahweh. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"20 While Ornan was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the angel. He and his four sons with him hid themselves. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"21 When David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David. He left the threshing floor and bowed to David with his face to the ground. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"22 Then David said to Ornan, “Sell me this threshing floor, so I can build an altar for Yahweh. I will pay the full price, so that the plague may be removed from the people.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"23 Ornan said to David, “Take it as your own, my master the king. Do with it what is good in your sight. Look, I will give you oxen for burnt offerings, threshing sledges for wood, and wheat for the grain offering; I will give it all to you.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"24 King David said to Ornan, “No, I insist on buying it for the full price. I will not take what is yours and offer it as a burnt offering to Yahweh if it costs me nothing.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,25 So David paid six hundred shekels of gold for the place. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"26 David built an altar for Yahweh there and offered on it burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He called on Yahweh, who answered him with fire from heaven on the altar for burnt offerings. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"27 Then Yahweh gave an order to the angel, and the angel put his sword back into its sheath. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"28 When David saw that Yahweh had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he performed the sacrifice there at that same time. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"29 Now at that time, Yahweh's tabernacle, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar for burnt offerings, were at the high place at Gibeon. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,21,"30 However, David could not go there to ask for God's direction, because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of Yahweh. 22 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,22,"1 Then David said, “This is where the house of Yahweh God will be, with the altar for the burnt offerings of Israel.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,22,"2 So David ordered his servants to gather together the foreigners living in the land of Israel. He assigned them to be stonecutters, to cut stone blocks, in order to build God's house. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,22,"3 David supplied a large amount of iron for the nails for the doors to go in the gateways, and for braces. He also supplied more bronze than could be weighed, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,22,4 and more cedar trees than could be counted. (The Sidonians and the Tyrians brought too many cedar logs to David to count.) 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,22,"5 David said, “My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for Yahweh must be especially magnificent, so that it will be famous and glorious in all other lands. So I will prepare for its building.” So David made extensive preparations before his death. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,22,"6 Then he called for Solomon his son and commanded him to build a house for Yahweh, the God of Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,22,"7 David said to Solomon, “My son, it was my intention to build a house myself, for the name of Yahweh my God. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,22,"8 But Yahweh came to me and said, 'You have shed much blood and have fought many battles. You will not build a house for my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,22,"9 However, you will have a son who will be a peaceful man. I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side. For his name will be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,22,"10 He will build a house for my name. He will be my son, and I will be his father. I will establish the throneof his kingdom over Israel forever.' "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,22,"11 Now, my son, may Yahweh be with you and enable you to succeed. May you build the house of Yahweh your God, as he said you would. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,22,"12 Only may Yahweh give you insight and understanding, so that you may obey the law of Yahweh your God, when he places you in charge over Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,22,"13 Then you will succeed, if you carefully obey the statutes and the decrees that Yahweh gave to Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and courageous. Do not fear or be discouraged. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,22,"14 Now, see, at great effort I have prepared for Yahweh's house 100,"
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,22,"000 talents of gold, one million talents of silver, and bronze and iron in large quantities. I have also provided timber and stone. You must add more to all this. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,22,"15 You have many workmen with you stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and skillful craftsmen without number of every kind, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,22,"16 who can work with gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Arise and begin the work, and may Yahweh be with you.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,22,"17 David also ordered all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,22,18 “Yahweh your God is with you and has given you peace on every side. He has given the region's inhabitants into my hand. The region is subdued before Yahweh and his people. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,22,19 Now seek Yahweh your God with all your heart and your soul. Get up and build the holy place of Yahweh God. Then you can bring the ark of the covenant of Yahweh and the things that belong to God into the house built for Yahweh's name.” 23 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"1 When David was old and near the end of his life, he made Solomon his son king over Israel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"2 He gathered together all the leaders of Israel, with the priests and Levites. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,3 The Levites who were thirty years old and older were counted. They numbered thirty-eight thousand. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"4 “Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of Yahweh's house, and six thousand were officers and judges. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"5 Four thousand were gatekeepers, and four thousand were to praise Yahweh with the instruments that I made to give praise,” David said. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"6 He divided them into groups that corresponded to Levi's sons Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"7 From the clans descended from Gershon, there were Ladan and Shimei. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"8 There were three of Ladan's sons Jehiel the leader, Zetham, and Joel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"9 There were three of Shimei's sons Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran. These were the leaders of the clans of Ladan. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"10 There were four of Shimei's sons Jahath, Ziza, Jeush, and Beriah. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"11 Jahath was the oldest, and Ziza the second, but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they were considered as one clan with the same duties. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"12 There were four of Kohath's sons Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"13 These were Amram's sons Aaron and Moses. Aaron was chosen to set apart the most holy things, that he and his descendants would offer incense before Yahweh, to serve him and to give blessings in his name forever. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"14 But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were considered to be Levites. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,15 Moses' sons were Gershom and Eliezer. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,16 Gershom's descendant was Shubael the oldest. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"17 Eliezer's descendant was Rehabiah. Eliezer had no other sons, but Rehabiah had many descendants. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,18 Izhar's son was Shelomith the leader. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"19 Hebron's descendants were Jeriah, the oldest, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"20 Uzziel's sons were Micah the oldest, and Ishijah the second. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,21 Merari's sons were Mahli and Mushi. Mahli's sons were Eleazar and Kish. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,22 Eleazar died without having any sons. He had only daughters. The sons of Kish married them. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"23 Mushi's three sons were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"24 These were Levi's descendants corresponding to their clans. They were the leaders, counted and listed by name, of the clans that did the work in the service of Yahweh's house, from twenty years old and upward. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"25 For David said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people. He makes his home in Jerusalem forever. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,26 The Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all the equipment used in its service.” 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"27 For by David's last words the Levites were counted, from twenty years old and upward. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"28 Their duty was to assist Aaron's descendants in the service of Yahweh's house. They were to care for the courtyards, the rooms, the ceremonial purification of all the things that belong to Yahweh, and other work in the service of God's house. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"29 They also took care of the bread of the presence, the fine flour for grain offerings, the unleavened wafers, the baked offerings, the offerings mixed with oil, and all the measuring of the amounts and sizes of things. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,30 They also stood every morning to thank and praise Yahweh. They also did this in the evening 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"31 and whenever burnt offerings were offered to Yahweh, on the Sabbath and at the new moon festivals and feast days. A fixed number, assigned by decree, always had to be present before Yahweh. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,1 Chronicles,23,"32 They were in charge of the tent of meeting, the holy place, and helped their fellow descendants of Aaron in the service of Yahweh's house. 24 "

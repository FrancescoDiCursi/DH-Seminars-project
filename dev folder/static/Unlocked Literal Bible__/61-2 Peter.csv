Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter, Second Peter,
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,1,"1 Simon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have received the same precious faith as we have received, faith in the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,1,2 May grace and peace increase in measure in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,1,"3 All the things concerning divine power for life and godliness have been given to us through the knowledge of God, who called us through his own glory and excellence. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,1,"4 Through these, he gave us precious and great promises, so that you might be sharers in the divine nature, having escaped the corruption in the world that is caused by evil desires. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,1,"5 For this reason, do your best to add goodness to your faith; and to goodness add knowledge; "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,1,6 to knowledge add self-control; to self-control add endurance; to endurance add godliness; 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,1,7 to godliness add brotherly affection; and to brotherly affection add love. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,1,"8 If these things are in you and grow in you, you will not be barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,1,"9 But whoever lacks these things is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten he has been cleansed from his past sins. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,1,"10 Therefore, brothers, do your best to make your calling and election sure, for if you do these things, you will not stumble. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,1,11 In this way there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,1,"12 Therefore I will always be ready to remind you of these things, although you know them, and although you are strong in the truth you now have. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,1,"13 It is proper for me to think, as long as I am in this tent, to stir you up by way of reminder. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,1,"14 For I know that the putting off of my tent will be soon, because our Lord Jesus Christ has revealed this to me. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,1,15 I will make every effort to see that after my departure you may be always able to remember these things. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,1,"16 For we did not follow cleverly invented myths when we made known to you the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,1,"17 For he received honor and glory from God the Father when a voice was brought to him by the Majestic Glory saying, “This is my beloved Son, with him I am well pleased.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,1,18 We ourselves heard this voice brought from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,1,"19 For we have this prophetic word made more sure, and you do well to pay attention to it, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,1,"20 Above all, you must understand that no prophecy comes from someone's own interpretation. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,1,"21 For no prophecy was ever brought by the will of man, but men spoke from God when they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. 2 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,2,"1 False prophets came to the people, and false teachers will also come to you. They will secretly bring with them destructive heresies, and they will deny the master who bought them. They are bringing quick destruction upon themselves. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,2,"2 Many will follow their sensuality, and through them the way of truth will be blasphemed. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,2,"3 In their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words. For a long time their condemnation has not been idle, and their destruction is not asleep. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,2,4 For God did not spare the angels who sinned. Instead he handed them down to Tartarus to be kept in chains of lower darkness until the judgment. * *
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,2,"5 Also, he did not spare the ancient world. Instead, he preserved Noah, who was a herald of righteousness, along with seven others, when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,2,"6 God also reduced the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes and condemned them to destruction, as an example of what is to happen to the ungodly. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,2,"7 But as for the righteous Lot, he was oppressed by the sensual behavior of lawless people. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,2,"8 So that righteous man, who was living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul because of what he saw and heard. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,2,"9 The Lord knows how to rescue godly men out of trials, and how to hold unrighteous men for punishment at the day of judgment. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,2,"10 This is especially true for those who continue in the corrupt desires of the flesh and who despise authority. Bold and self-willed, they are not afraid to blaspheme the glorious ones. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,2,"11 Angels have greater strength and power, but they do not bring insulting judgments against them to the Lord. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,2,12 But these unreasoning animals are naturally made for capture and destruction. They do not know what they insult. They will be destroyed. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,2,13 They will receive the reward of their wrongdoing. They think that luxury during the day is a pleasure. They are stains and blemishes. They enjoy their deceitful actions while they are feasting with you. † 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,2,"14 They have eyes full of adultery, they are never satisfied with sin. They entice unstable souls into wrongdoing, and they have their hearts trained in covetousness. They are cursed children! "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,2,"15 They have abandoned the right way and have wandered off to follow the way of Balaam son of Beor, who loved to receive payment for unrighteousness. ‡ "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,2,16 But he obtained a rebuke for his own transgression—a mute donkey speaking in a human voice stopped the prophet's insanity. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,2,17 These men are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. The gloom of thick darkness is reserved for them. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,2,18 They speak with vain arrogance. They entice people through the lusts of the flesh. They entice people who try to escape from those who live in error. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,2,"19 They promise freedom to them, but they themselves are slaves of corruption. For a man is a slave to whatever overcomes him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,2,"20 If they have escaped the corruption of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,2,21 It would have been better for them not to know the way of righteousness than to know it and turn away from the holy commandment delivered to them. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,2,"22 This proverb is true for them “A dog returns to its own vomit, and a washed pig returns to the mud.” 3 "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,3,"1 Beloved, this is now the second letter that I have written to you; and in both of them they are reminders to stir up your sincere mind, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,3,2 so that you will recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command of our Lord and Savior given through your apostles. 
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,3,"3 Know this first, that mockers will come in the last days. They will mock and proceed according to their own desires. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,3,"4 They will say, “Where is the promise of his return? From when our fathers fell asleep, all things have stayed the same, since the beginning of creation.” "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,3,"5 They willfully forget that the heavens and the earth came to exist out of water and through water, long ago, by God's command, "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,3,"6 and that through these things, the world of that time was destroyed, being flooded with water. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,3,7 But now the heavens and the earth are reserved for fire by that same command. They are reserved for the day of judgment and the destruction of the ungodly people. †
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,3,"8 It should not escape your notice, beloved, that one day with the Lord is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like one day. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,3,"9 The Lord does not move slowly concerning his promises, as some consider slowness to be. Instead, he is patient toward you. He does not desire for any of you to perish, but for everyone to make room for repentance. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,3,"10 However, the day of the Lord will come as a thief The heavens will pass away with a loud noise. The elements will be burned with fire, and the earth and the deeds in it will be revealed. * "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,3,"11 Since all these things will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people should you be? You should live holy and godly lives. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,3,"12 You should expect and hasten the coming of the day of God. On that day, the heavens will be destroyed by fire, and the elements will be melted in great heat. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,3,"13 But according to his promise, we are waiting for the new heavens and the new earth, where righteousness will dwell. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,3,"14 Therefore, beloved, since you expect these things, do your best to be found spotless and blameless before him, in peace. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,3,"15 Also, consider the patience of our Lord to be salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul wrote to you, according to the wisdom that was given to him. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,3,"16 Paul speaks of these things in all his letters, in which there are things that are difficult to understand. Ignorant and unstable men distort these things, as they also do the other scriptures, to their own destruction. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,3,"17 Therefore, beloved, since you know about these things beforehand, guard yourselves so that you are not led astray by the deceit of lawless people and you lose your own faithfulness. "
Unlocked Literal Bible__,2 Peter,3,18 But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. May the glory be to him both now and forever. Amen! *

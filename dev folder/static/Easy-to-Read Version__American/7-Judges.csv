Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,1,34 The Amorites forced the tribe of Dan to live in the hill country. They had to stay in the hills because the Amorites would not let them come down to live in the † valleys.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,1,2 The Angel of the Lord at Bokim

I told you I would never break my agreement with you. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,2,"2 But in return, you must never make any agreement with the people living in that land. You must destroy their altars. I told you that, but you didn’t obey me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,2,"3 “Now I will tell you this, ‘I will not force the other people to leave this land any longer. These people will become a problem for you. They will be like a trap to you. Their false gods will become like a net to trap you.’ ” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,2,"4 After the angel gave the Israelites this message from the LORD, the people cried loudly. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,2,5 So they named the place Bokim.* There they offered sacrifices to the LORD. Disobedience and Defeat 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,2,"6 Then Joshua told the people to go home, so each tribe went to take their area of land. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,2,"7 The Israelites served the LORD as long as Joshua was alive, and they continued serving the Lord during the lifetimes of the elders who lived after Joshua had died. These old men had seen all the great things the LORD had done for the Israelites. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,2,"8 Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of  110 years. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,2,"9 The Israelites buried Joshua on the land that he had been given. That was at Timnath Heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,2,"10 After that whole generation died, the next generation grew up. This new generation did not know about the LORD or what he had done for the Israelites. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,2,11 So the Israelites did something very evil before the LORD. They began serving the false god Baal. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,2,"12 It was the LORD, the God their ancestors worshiped, who had brought the Israelites out of Egypt. But they stopped following him and began to worship the false gods of the people living around them. This made the LORD angry. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,2,13 The Israelites stopped following the LORD and began worshiping Baal and Ashtoreth. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,2,"14 The LORD was angry with the Israelites, so he let enemies attack them and take their possessions. He let their enemies who lived around them defeat them. The Israelites could not protect themselves from their enemies. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,2,"15 When the Israelites went out to fight, they always lost. They lost because the LORD was not on their side. He had already warned them that they would lose if they served the gods of the people living around them. The Israelites suffered very much. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,2,16 Then the LORD chose leaders called judges. These leaders saved the Israelites from the enemies who took their possessions. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,2,"17 But the Israelites did not listen to their judges. The Israelites were not faithful to God—they followed other gods.† In the past, the ancestors of the Israelites obeyed the LORD’S commands. But now the Israelites changed and stopped obeying the Lord. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,2,"18 Many times the enemies of Israel did bad things to the people, so the Israelites would cry for help. And each time the LORD felt sorry for the people * and sent a judge to save them from their enemies. The LORD was always withthose judges. Each time the Israelites were saved from their enemies. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,2,"19 But when each judge died, the Israelites again sinned and started worshiping the false gods. They acted worse than their ancestors did. The Israelites were very stubborn and refused to change their evil ways. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,2,"20 So the LORD became angry with the Israelites, and he said, “This nation has broken the agreement that I made with their ancestors. They have not listened to me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,2,"21 So I will no longer defeat the nations and clear the way for the Israelites. Those nations were still in this land when Joshua died, and I will let them stay in this land. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,2,22 I will use them to test the Israelites. I will see if the Israelites can keep the LORD’S commands as their ancestors did.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,2,23 The LORD allowed those nations to stay in the land. He did not quickly force them to leave the country. He did not help Joshua’s army defeat them. 3 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,1-2 The LORD did not force all the other nations to leave Israel’s land. He wanted to test the Israelites. None of the Israelites living at this time had fought in the wars to take the land of Canaan. So he let those other nations stay in their country. (He did this to teach the Israelites who had not fought in those wars.) These are the nations the Lord left in the land 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"3 the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the people of Sidon, and the Hivites who lived in the Lebanon mountains from Mount Baal Hermon to Lebo Hamath. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,4 He left those nations in the land to test the Israelites. He wanted to see if the Israelites would obey the LORD’S commands that he had given to their ancestors through Moses. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"5 The Israelites lived with the Canaanites, Hittites, the Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"6 The Israelites began to marry the daughters of those people. They allowed their own daughters to marry the sons of those people. The Israelites also began to worship their gods. Othniel, the First Judge "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,7 The LORD saw that the Israelites did evil things. They forgot about the LORD their God and served the false gods Baal and Asherah. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"8 The LORD was angry with the Israelites, so he allowed King Cushan Rishathaim of Aram Naharaim* to defeat the Israelites and to rule over them. The Israelites were under that king’s rule for eight years. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"9 But the Israelites cried to the LORD for help, and the LORD sent a man named Othniel to save them. He was the son of Kenaz, who was Caleb’s younger brother. Othniel saved the Israelites. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"10 The Spirit of the LORD filled Othniel, and he became a judge for the Israelites. He led the Israelites to war. The LORD helped Othniel defeat King Cushan Rishathaim of Aram. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"11 So the land was at peace for  40 years, until Othniel son of Kenaz died. Ehud, the Judge "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"12 Again the Israelites did things the LORD considered evil, and the LORD saw them doing these things. So the LORD gave King Eglon of Moab power to defeat the Israelites. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,13 Eglon got help from the Ammonites and the Amalekites. They joined him and attacked the Israelites. Eglon and his army defeated the Israelites and forced them to leave the City of Palm Trees.† 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,14 King Eglon of Moab ruled over the Israelites for  18 years. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"15 The Israelites cried to the LORD for help, so he sent a man named Ehud son of Gera to save them. Ehud was from the tribe of Benjamin and was trained to fight with his left hand. The Israelites sent Ehud with a gift to King Eglon of * Moab. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,16 Ehud made himself a sword with two sharp edges that was about 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,12 inches‡ long. He tied the sword to his right thigh and hid it under his uniform. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,17 So Ehud brought the gift to King Eglon of Moab. Eglon was a very fat man. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"18 After offering the gift, Ehud left the palace with the men who had carried the gift. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"19 When Ehud reached the statues§ near Gilgal, he turned and went back to King Eglon and said, “King, I have a secret message for you.” The king told him to be quiet and then sent all the servants out of the room. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"20 Ehud went to King Eglon. The king was sitting all alone in the upper room of his palace. Then Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” The king stood up from his throne. He was very close to Ehud. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"21 As the king was getting up from his throne,* Ehud reached with his left hand and took out the sword that was tied to his right thigh. Then he pushed the sword into the king’s belly. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,22 The sword went into Eglon’s belly so far that even the handle sank in and the fat closed around it. The point of the blade came out his back. Ehud left the sword inside Eglon. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"23 Then Ehud went out of the private room, closed the doors to the upper room, and locked the king inside. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"24 Ehud then left the main room, and the servants went back in. The servants found the doors to the upper room locked, so they said, “The king must be relieving himself in his private toilet.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"25 The servants waited for a long time, but the king never opened the doors to the upper room. Finally, the servants got worried. They got the key and unlocked the doors. When the servants entered, they saw their king lying dead on the floor. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"26 While the servants were waiting for the king, Ehud had time to escape. He passed by the statues and went toward the place named Seirah. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"27 When Ehud came to Seirah, he blew a trumpet there in the hill country of Ephraim. The Israelites heard the trumpet and went down from the hills with Ehud leading them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"28 He said to the Israelites, “Follow me! The LORD has helped us defeat our enemies, the Moabites.” So the Israelites followed Ehud. They went down with him to take control of the places where people could easily cross the Jordan River into the land of Moab. The Israelites did not allow any one to go across the Jordan River. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"29 They killed about 10,"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,000 strong and brave men from Moab. Not one Moabite man escaped. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"30 So on that day the Israelites began to rule over the Moabites, and there was peace in the land for  80 years. Shamgar, the Judge "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"31 After Ehud saved the Israelites, another man saved Israel. That man’s name was Shamgar son of Anath.† Shamgar used an ox goad to kill "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,600 Philistine men. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,3,"4 Deborah, the Judge "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,"1 After Ehud died, the people again did what the LORD said was wrong. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,2 So the LORD allowed King Jabin of Canaan to defeat the Israelites. Jabin ruled in a city named Hazor. A man named Sisera was the commander of King Jabin’s army. Sisera lived in a town called Harosheth Haggoyim. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,3 Sisera had 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,"900 iron ‡ chariots, and he was very cruel to the Israelites for  20 years. So they cried to the LORD for help. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,4 There was a woman prophet named Deborah. She was the wife of a man named Lappidoth. She was judge of Israel at that time. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,"5 One day Deborah was sitting under the Palm Tree of Deborah, and the Israelites came up to her to ask what to do about Sisera. (The Palm Tree of Deborah is between the cities of Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim.) "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,"6 Deborah sent a message to a man named Barak and asked him to come meet with her. Barak was the son of a man named Abinoam. Barak lived in the city of Kedesh, which is in the area of Naphtali. Deborah said to Barak, “The LORD, the God of Israel, commands you ‘Go and gather 10, 000 men from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun. Lead them to Mount Tabor. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,"7 I will make Sisera, the commander of King Jabin’s army, come to you. I will make Sisera, his chariots, and his army come to the Kishon River.* I will help you defeat Sisera there.’ ” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,"8 Then Barak said to Deborah, “I will go and do this if you will go with me. But if you will not go with me, I will not go.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,"9 “Of course I will go with you,” Deborah answered. “But because of your attitude, you will not be honored when Sisera is defeated. The LORD will allow a woman to defeat Sisera.” So Deborah went with Barak to the city of Kedesh. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,"10 At the city of Kedesh, Barak called the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali together. He gathered 10, 000 men to follow him from these tribes, and Deborah also went with him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,"11 There was a man named Heber who was from the Kenites. The Kenites were descendants of Moses’ father-in-law,† Hobab. Heber had left the other Kenites and had made his home by the oak tree in Zaanannim, near the city of Kedesh. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,12 Someone told Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam was at Mount Tabor. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,13 So Sisera gathered his 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,"900 iron chariots and all the men with him, and they marched from the city of Harosheth Haggoyim to the Kishon River. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,"14 Then Deborah said to Barak, “Today the LORD will help you defeat Sisera. Surely you know that the LORD has already cleared the way for you.” So Barak led the 10, 000 men down from Mount Tabor. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,"15 Barak and his men attacked Sisera. During the battle, the LORD confused Sisera and his army and chariots. They did not know what to do. Barak and his men defeated Sisera’s army, but Sisera left his chariot and ran away on foot. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,16 Barak continued fighting Sisera’s army. He and his men chased Sisera’s chariots and army all the way to Harosheth Haggoyim. They used their swords to kill all of Sisera’s men. Not one of Sisera’s men was left alive. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,17 But Sisera ran away to the tent where a woman named Jael lived. Jael was the wife of Heber the Kenite. His family was at peace with King Jabin of Hazor. That is why Sisera ran to Jael’s tent. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,"18 Jael saw him coming, so she went out to meet him and said, “Sir, come into my tent. Come in. Don’t be afraid.” So Sisera went into Jael’s tent, and she covered him with a blanket. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,"19 But first, Sisera asked Jael for a drink of water. Jael had some milk in a bottle made from animal skin. So she gave him a drink of the milk and then covered him up. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,"20 Then Sisera said to Jael, “Go stand at the entrance to the tent. If anyone comes by and asks you, ‘Is anyone in there?’ say, ‘No.’ ” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,"21 But Jael found a tent peg and a hammer. She quietly went to Sisera. Sisera was very tired, so he was sleeping. She put the tent peg to the side of Sisera’s * head and hit it with a hammer. The tent peg went through the side of his headand into the ground. Sisera died."
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,"22 Just then Barak came by Jael’s tent, looking for Sisera. Jael went out to meet Barak and said, “Come in here, and I will show you the man you are looking for.” So Barak entered the tent with Jael. There Barak found Sisera lying dead on the ground, with the tent peg through the side of his head. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,23 On that day God defeated King Jabin of Canaan for the Israelites. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,24 So the Israelites became stronger and stronger until they defeated King Jabin of Canaan. The Israelites finally destroyed him.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,4,"17 The people of Gilead‡ stayed in their camps on the other side of the Jordan River. As for you, people of Dan, why did you stay by your ships? The people of Asher remained by the sea, camped near their safe harbors. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,5,2 The Midianites were very powerful and were cruel to the Israelites. So the Israelites made many hiding places in the mountains. They hid their food in caves and places that were hard to find.

The angel of the LORD appeared to Gideon and said, “The LORD be with you, brave soldier.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,5,"13 Then Gideon said, “Pardon me, sir, but if the LORD is with us, why are we having so many troubles? We heard that he did wonderful things for our ancestors. They tell us that the LORD took them out of Egypt. But now it seems the LORD has left us and is letting the Midianites defeat us.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,5,"14 The LORD turned toward Gideon and said, “Then use your great power and go save the Israelites from the Midianites. I am sending you to save them.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,5,"15 But Gideon answered and said, “Pardon me, sir.‡ How can I save Israel? My family group is the weakest in the tribe of Manasseh, and I am the youngest one in my family.” "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,5,"18 Please wait here. Don’t go away until I come back to you. Let me bring my offering and set it down in front of you.” And the Lord said, “I will wait until you come back.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,5,19 So Gideon went in and cooked a young goat in boiling water. He also took about

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,5,26 Then build the right kind of altar for the LORD your God. Build it on this high ground. Then kill and burn the bull on this altar. Use the wood from the Asherah pole to burn your offering.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,5,"27 So Gideon took ten of his servants and did what the LORD had told him to do. But Gideon was afraid that his family and the men of the city might see what he was doing, so he did it all at night, not in the daytime. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,5,28 The men of the city got up the next morning and saw that the altar for Baal had been destroyed! They also saw that the Asherah pole had been cut down.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,5,"30 So the men of the city came to Joash and said, “You must bring your son out. He pulled down the altar for Baal, and he cut down the Asherah pole that was beside it. So your son must die.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,5,"31 Then Joash spoke to the crowd that was standing around him. Joash said, “Are you going to take Baal’s side? Are you going to rescue Baal? If anyone takes Baal’s side, let him be put to death by morning. If Baal really is a god, let him defend himself when someone pulls down his altar.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,5,"32 Joash said, “If Gideon pulled Baal’s altar down, let Baal argue with him.” On that day Joash gave Gideon a new name. He called him Jerub-Baal.§ Gideon Defeats the Midianites "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,5,"35 He sent messengers to all the people of the tribe of Manasseh and told them to get their weapons and prepare for battle. Gideon also sent messengers to the tribes of Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali. The messengers took the same message to them. So they also went up to meet Gideon and his men. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,5,"36 Then Gideon said to God, “You said that you would help me save the Israelites. Give me proof. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,5,"37 I will put a sheepskin on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the sheepskin, while all the ground is dry, I will know that you will use me to save Israel, as you said.” "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,5,"39 Then Gideon said to God, “Don’t be angry with me. Let me ask just one more thing. Let me test you one more time with the sheepskin. This time let the sheepskin be dry, while the ground around it gets wet with dew.” "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,6,"2 Then the LORD said to Gideon, “I am going to help your men defeat the Midianites, but you have too many men. I don’t want the Israelites to forget me and brag that they saved themselves. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,6,"3 So make an announcement to your men. Tell them, ‘Anyone who is afraid may leave Mount Gilead and go back home.’ ” At that time 22, 000 men left Gideon and went back home, but 10,"

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,6,"4 Then the LORD said to Gideon, “There are still too many men. Take the men down to the water, and I will test them for you there. If I say, ‘This man will go with you,’ he will go. But if I say, ‘That one will not go with you,’ then he will not go.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,6,"5 So Gideon led the men down to the water. There the LORD said to him, “Separate the men like this Those who drink the water by using their tongue to lap it up like a dog will be in one group. And those who bend down to drink will be in the other group.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,6,6 There were  300 men who used their hands to bring water to their mouth and lapped it like a dog does. All the other people bent down and drank the water.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,6,"14 The man’s friend knew the meaning of the dream. He said, “Your dream can only have one meaning. Your dream is about that man from Israel. It is about Gideon son of Joash. It means that God will let Gideon defeat the whole army of Midian.” "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,70 sons—and they were his own brothers. The leaders of Shechem had supported him in doing this evil thing. So God caused trouble between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem. And they began planning ways to hurt Abimelech. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,25 The leaders of the city of Shechem did not like Abimelech anymore. They put men on the hilltops to attack and rob everyone who went by. Abimelech found out about the attacks. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,26 A man named Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers moved to the city of Shechem. The leaders of the city of Shechem decided to trust and follow Gaal. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,27 One day the people of Shechem went out to the vineyards to pick grapes. They squeezed the grapes to make wine. And then they had a party at the temple of their god. The people ate and drank and cursed Abimelech. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,"28 Then Gaal son of Ebed said, “We are the men of Shechem. Why should we obey Abimelech? Who does he think he is? Abimelech is one of Gideon’s sons, right? And Abimelech made Zebul his officer, right? We should not obey Abimelech. We should follow our own people, men from Hamor.* (Hamor was the father of Shechem.) "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,"29 If you make me the commander of these people, I will destroy Abimelech. I will say to him, ‘Get your army ready and come out to battle.’ ” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,"30 Zebul was the governor of the city of Shechem. Zebul heard what Gaal son of Ebed said, and he became very angry. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,31 Zebul sent messengers to Abimelech in the city of Arumah.† This is the message “Gaal son of Ebed and Gaal’s brothers have come to the city of Shechem. They are making trouble for you. Gaal is turning the whole city against you. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,32 So now you and your men should come tonight and hide in the fields outside the city. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,"33 When the sun comes up in the morning, attack the city. Gaal and his men will come out of the city to fight you. When they come out to fight, do what you can to them.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,34 So Abimelech and all his soldiers got up during the night and went to the city. The soldiers separated into four groups. They hid near the city of Shechem. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,"35 Gaal son of Ebed went out and was standing at the entrance to the gate of the city of Shechem. While Gaal was standing there, Abimelech and his soldiers came out of their hiding places. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,"36 When Gaal saw the soldiers, he said to Zebul, “Look, there are people coming down from the mountains.” But Zebul said, “You are only seeing the shadows of the mountains. The shadows just look like people.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,"37 But again Gaal said, “Look, there are some people coming down from that place over there by Land’s Navel. And there! I saw someone’s head over by Magician’s Tree.‡” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,"38 Zebul said to Gaal, “Why aren’t you bragging now? You * said, ‘Who is Abimelech? Why should we obey him?’ You made fun of these men.Now go out and fight them.”"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,39 So Gaal led the leaders of Shechem out to fight Abimelech. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,"40 Abimelech and his men chased Gaal and his men. Gaal’s men ran back toward the gate of the city of Shechem, but many were killed before they could get back to the gate. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,41 Then Abimelech returned to the city of Arumah. Zebul forced Gaal and his brothers to leave the city of Shechem. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,42 The next day the people of Shechem went out to the fields to work. Abimelech found out about it. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,"43 So Abimelech separated his men into three groups. He wanted to attack the people of Shechem by surprise. So he hid his men in the fields. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he jumped up and attacked them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,44 Abimelech and his group ran to a place near the gate to Shechem. The other two groups ran out to the people in the fields and killed them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,45 Abimelech and his men fought against the city of Shechem all that day. They captured the city of Shechem and killed its people. Then Abimelech tore down the city and threw salt over the ruins. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,"46 There were some people who lived at the Tower of Shechem.§ When they heard what had happened to Shechem, they gathered together in the safest room* of the temple of the god El Berith.† "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,47 Abimelech heard that all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem had gathered together. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,"48 So Abimelech and all his men went up to Mount Zalmon.‡ Abimelech took an ax and cut off some branches and carried them on his shoulders. Then Abimelech said to the men with him, “Hurry! Do the same thing that I have done.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,49 So all the men cut branches and followed Abimelech. They piled the branches against the safest room of the temple of the god El Berith. Then they set the branches on fire and burned the people in the room. About  1000 men and women living near the Tower of Shechem died. Abimelech’s Death 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,50 Then Abimelech and his men went to the city of Thebez and captured that city. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,"51 But inside the city there was a strong tower, so all the leaders and other men and women of that city ran to the tower. When the people were inside the tower, they locked the door behind them. Then they climbed up to the roof of the tower. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,52 Abimelech and his men came to the tower to attack it. Abimelech went up to the door of the tower to burn it. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,"53 But, while Abimelech was standing at the door of the tower, a woman on the roof dropped a grinding stone on his head. The grinding stone crushed his skull. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,"54 Abimelech quickly said to the servant who carried his weapons, “Take out your sword and kill me. I want you to kill me so that people will not say, ‘A woman killed Abimelech.’ ” So the servant stabbed Abimelech with his sword, and he died. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,"55 The Israelites saw that Abimelech was dead, so they all went back home. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,56 In that way God punished Abimelech for all the bad things he had done. Abimelech sinned against his own father by killing his 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,70 brothers. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,8,57 God also punished the men of the city of Shechem for the bad things they had done. So the things said by Jotham son of Gideon came true. §

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,9,"1 After Abimelech died, God sent another judge to save the Israelites. His name was Tola. He was the son of Puah, who was the son of Dodo. Tola was from the tribe of Issachar and lived in the city of Shamir, in the hill country of Ephraim. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,9,30 sons who rode 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,9,30 donkeys.* These

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,9,"6 Again the Israelites did what the LORD said was wrong. They began worshiping the false gods Baal and the Ashtoreth. They also worshiped the gods of the people of Aram, the gods of the people of Sidon, the gods of the Moabites, the gods of the Ammonites, and the gods of the Philistines. The Israelites left the LORD and stopped serving him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,9,7 So the LORD became angry with the Israelites and allowed the Philistines and the Ammonites to defeat them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,9,"8 In that same year those people destroyed the Israelites who lived on the east side of the Jordan River, in the area of Gilead. That is the land where the Amorites had lived. The Israelites suffered for  18 years. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,9,"10 So the Israelites cried to the LORD for help. They said, “God, we have sinned against you. We left our God and worshiped the false god Baal.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,9,"11 The LORD answered the Israelites, “You cried to me when the Egyptians, the Amorites, the Ammonites, and the Philistines hurt you. I saved you from these people. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,9,"12 You cried to me when the people of Sidon, the Amalekites, and the Midianites† hurt you. I also saved you from those people. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,9,"13 But you left me and started worshiping other gods, so I refuse to save you again. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,9,"14 You like worshiping those gods, so go call to them for help. Let them save you when you are in trouble.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,9,"15 But the Israelites said to the LORD, “We have sinned. Do whatever you want to do to us, but please save us today.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,9,16 Then the Israelites threw away the foreign gods and began to worship the LORD again. So he felt sorry for them when he saw them suffering. Jephthah Is Chosen as a Leader

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,10,4 After a time the Ammonites fought with the Israelites. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,10,"5 The Ammonites were fighting against Israel, so the elders in Gilead went to Jephthah. They wanted Jephthah to leave the land of Tob and come back to Gilead. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,10,"6 The elders said to Jephthah, “Come and be our leader so that we can fight the Ammonites.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,10,"7 But Jephthah said to the elders of the land of Gilead, “You forced me to leave my father’s house. You hate me. So why are you coming to me now that you are having trouble?” "

They took our land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River to the Jordan River. Now, tell the Israelites to give our land back to us without fighting for it.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,10,14 So the messengers of Jephthah took this message back to Jephthah.* Then Jephthah sent the messengers to the king of the Ammonites again. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,10,15 They took this message “This is what Jephthah says Israel did not take the land of the Moabites or the land of the Ammonites.

"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,11,"5 The men of Gilead captured the places where people cross the Jordan River. Those places led to the country of Ephraim.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,11,"6 they would say, “Say the word ‘Shibboleth.’ ” The men of Ephraim could not say that word correctly.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,14,"12 Then they said to Samson, “We have come to tie you up. We will give you to the Philistines.” Samson said to the men from Judah, “Promise me that you yourselves will not hurt me.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,14,"13 The men from Judah said, “We agree. We will just tie you up and give you to the Philistines. We promise that we will not kill you.” So they tied Samson with two new ropes and led him up from the cave in the rock. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,14,"14 When Samson came to the place called Lehi, the Philistines came to meet him. They were shouting with joy.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,14,"19 There is a hole in the ground at Lehi. God made that hole crack open, and water came out. Samson drank the water and felt better. He felt strong again. So he named that water spring En Hakkore.‡ It is still there in the city of Lehi today. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,15,"14 Later, Samson went to sleep, so Delilah used the loom to weave the seven braids of hair on his head.‡ Then Delilah fastened the loom to the ground with a tent peg. Again she called out to him, “Samson, the Philistine men are going to capture you!” Samson pulled up the tent peg, the loom, and the shuttle.§ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,15,"15 Then Delilah said to Samson, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when you don’t even trust me? You refuse to tell me your secret. This is the third time you made me look foolish. You haven’t told me the secret of your great strength.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,15,16 She kept bothering Samson day after day. He got so tired of her asking him about his secret that he felt like he was going to die. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,15,"17 Finally, Samson told Delilah everything. He said, “I have never had my hair cut. I was dedicated to God before I was born. If someone shaved my head, I would lose my strength. I would become as weak as any other man.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,15,"18 Delilah saw that Samson had told her his secret. She sent a message to the rulers of the Philistines. She said, “Come back again.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,15,"19 Delilah got Samson to go to sleep with his head lying in her lap. Then she called in a man to shave off the seven braids of Samson’s hair. In this way she made Samson weak, and his strength left him. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,15,"23 The Philistine rulers came together to celebrate. They were going to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon. They said, “Our god helped us defeat Samson our enemy.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,15,"24 When the Philistines saw Samson, they praised their god. They said, “This man destroyed our people! He killed many of our people! But our god helped us take our enemy!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,15,"25 The people were having a good time at the celebration. So they said, “Bring Samson out. We want to make fun of him.” So they brought Samson from the prison and made fun of him. They made him stand between the columns in the temple of the god Dagon. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,15,"30 Samson said, “Let me die with these Philistines!” Then he pushed as hard as he could, and the temple fell on the rulers and everyone in it. In this way Samson killed many more Philistines when he died than when he was alive. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,17,"3 When the five men came close to Micah’s house, they heard the voice of the young Levite. They recognized his voice, so they stopped at Micah’s house. They asked the young man, “Who brought you to this place? What are you doing? Why are you here?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,17,"4 The young man told them what Micah had done for him. “Micah hired me,” he said. “I am his priest.” "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,17,"6 The priest said to the five men, “Yes. Go in peace. The LORD will lead you on your way.” "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,17,"12 On their way to the city of Laish, they stopped near the city of Kiriath Jearim in the land of Judah. They set up a camp there. That is why the place west of Kiriath Jearim is named Mahaneh Dan† to this very day. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,17,13 From there the  600 men traveled on to the hill country of Ephraim. Then they came to Micah’s house.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,17,"19 The five men answered, “Be quiet! Don’t say a word. Come with us. Be our father and our priest. You must choose. Is it better for you to be a priest for just one man or for a whole tribe of Israelites with many family groups?” *"

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,17,"24 Micah answered, “You men from Dan took my idols. I made them for myself. You have also taken my priest. What do I have left now? How can you ask me, ‘What’s the problem?’ ” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,17,"25 The men from the tribe of Dan answered, “You had better not argue with us. Some of our men become angry easily. If you shout at us, they will attack you. You and your families will be killed.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,17,"26 Then the men of Dan turned around and went on their way. Micah knew that these men were too strong for him, so he went back home. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,17,27 So the men of Dan took the idols that Micah made. They also took the priest who had been with Micah. Then they came to Laish.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,17,"28 The people living in Laish did not have anyone to rescue them. They lived too far from the city of Sidon for the people there to help.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,"8 Then, on the fifth day, the Levite got up early in the morning. He was ready to leave. But the woman’s father said to his son-in-law, “Eat something first. Relax and stay until this afternoon.” So they both ate together again. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,"9 Then the Levite, his slave woman, and his servant got up to leave. But the young woman’s father said, “It is almost dark. The day is almost gone. So stay the night here and enjoy yourself. Tomorrow morning you can get up early and go on your way.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,"10 But the Levite did not want to stay another night. He took his two donkeys and his slave woman. He traveled as far as the city of Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,"11 The day was almost over. They were near the city of Jebus. So the servant said to his master, the Levite, “Let’s stop at this Jebusite city. Let’s stay the night here.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,"12 But his master, the Levite man, said, “No, we will not go inside a strange city. Those people are not Israelites. We will go to the city of Gibeah.*” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,"13 The Levite said, “Come on. Let’s try to make it to Gibeah or Ramah. We can stay the night in one of those cities.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,14 So the Levite and those with him traveled on. The sun was going down just as they entered the city of Gibeah. Gibeah is in the area that belongs to the tribe of Benjamin. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,"15 They planned to stop there and stay the night. They came to the city square and sat down, but no one invited them home to stay the night. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,"16 That evening an old man came into the city from the fields. His home was in the hill country of Ephraim, but now he was living in the city of Gibeah. (The men of Gibeah were from the tribe of Benjamin.) "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,"17 The old man saw the traveler in the public square and asked, “Where are you going? Where did you come from?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,"18 The Levite answered, “We have come from Bethlehem in Judah, where I went for a visit. Now I am on my way home,† which is a long way into the hill country of Ephraim. I expected that someone here would invite us in for the night, but no one has. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,"19 We already have straw and food for our donkeys. There is also bread and wine for me, the young woman, and my servant. We don’t need anything.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,"20 The old man said, “You are welcome to stay at my house. I will give you anything you need, but don’t stay the night in the public square.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,21 Then the old man took the Levite and the people with him to his house. He fed their donkeys. They washed their feet and then had something to eat and drink. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,"22 While the Levite and those who were with him were enjoying themselves, some very bad men from the city surrounded the house. They began beating on the door. They shouted at the old man who owned the house. They said, “Bring out the man who came to your house. We want to have sex with him.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,"23 The old man went outside and said to them, “My friends, don’t do such an evil thing! This man is a guest in my house.‡ Don’t commit this terrible sin. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,"24 Look, here is my daughter. She has never had sex before. I will bring her out to you * now. This man also has a slave woman. You can use them any way you want, butdon’t do such a terrible sin against this man.”"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,"25 But those evil men would not listen to the old man. So the Levite took his slave woman and put her outside with them. They hurt her and raped her all night long. Then, at dawn, they let her go. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,"26 At dawn, the woman came back to the house where her master was staying. She fell down at the front door and lay there until it was daylight. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,"27 The Levite got up early the next morning. He wanted to go home. He opened the door to go outside, and a hand fell across the threshold of the door. There was his slave woman. She had fallen down against the door. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,"28 The Levite said to her, “Get up; let’s go.” But there was no answer. The Levite put her body on his donkey and went home. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,"29 When he arrived at his house, he took a knife and cut her body into "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,12 parts. Then he sent the 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,12 parts of the woman to each of the areas where the Israelites lived. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,"30 Everyone who saw this said, “Nothing like this has ever happened in Israel before. We haven’t seen anything like this from the time we came out of Egypt. Discuss this and tell us what to do.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,18,20 The War Between Israel and Benjamin 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,1 So all the Israelites joined together. They all came together to stand before the LORD in the city of Mizpah. People came from everywhere in Israel.* Even the Israelites from Gilead† were there. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"2 The leaders of all the tribes of Israel were there. They took their places in the public meeting of God’s people. There were 400,"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,000 soldiers with swords in that place. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"3 The people from the tribe of Benjamin heard that the Israelites were meeting together in Mizpah. The Israelites said, “Tell us how this terrible thing happened.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"4 So the Levite, the husband of the woman who had been murdered, told them the story. He said, “My slave woman and I came to the city of Gibeah in the area of Benjamin. We spent the night there. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"5 But during the night the men of the city of Gibeah came to the house where I was staying. They surrounded the house, and they wanted to kill me. They raped my slave woman, and she died. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,6 So I took her and cut her into pieces. Then I sent one piece to each of the tribes of Israel. I sent the 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,12 pieces to the lands we have received. I did that because the people of Benjamin have done this terrible thing in Israel. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"7 Now, all you men of Israel, speak up. Give your decision about what we should do.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"8 Then all the people stood up at the same time. They said together, “None of us will go home. No, not one of us will go back to his house. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,9 Now this is what we will do to the city of Gibeah. We will throw lots to let God show us who will lead the attack. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,10 We will choose ten men from every 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,100 from all the tribes of Israel. And we will choose  100 men from every 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"1000. We will choose  1000 men from every 10,"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,000. These men we have chosen will get supplies for the army. Then the army will go to the city of Gibeah in the area of Benjamin. The army will punish those people for the terrible thing they did among the Israelites.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"11 So all the men of Israel gathered together at the city of Gibeah, united together and in agreement as to what they were doing. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,12 The tribes of Israel sent men to the tribe of Benjamin with this message “What about this terrible thing that some of your men have done? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"13 Send the bad men from the city of * Gibeah to us so that we can put them to death. We must remove the evil fromamong the Israelites.”But the people from the tribe of Benjamin would not listen to the messengersfrom their relatives, the other Israelites. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,14 The people from the tribe of Benjamin left their cities and went to the city of Gibeah. They went to Gibeah to fight against the other tribes of Israel. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"15 The people from the tribe of Benjamin got 26,"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,000 soldiers together who were trained for war. They also had 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,700 trained soldiers from the city of Gibeah. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,16 There were also 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,700 trained soldiers who were trained to fight with their left hand.‡ Each one of them could use a sling with great skill. They all could use a sling to throw a stone at a hair and not miss! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"17 All the tribes of Israel, except Benjamin, gathered together 400,"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,000 fighting men with swords. Each one was a trained soldier. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"18 The Israelites went up to the city of Bethel. At Bethel they asked God, “Which tribe will be first to attack the tribe of Benjamin?” The LORD answered, “The tribe of Judah will go first.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,19 The next morning the Israelites got up. They made a camp near the city of Gibeah. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,20 Then the army of Israel took their positions for battle against the army of Benjamin at the city of Gibeah. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"21 Then the army of Benjamin came out of the city of Gibeah. The army of Benjamin killed 22, 000 men in the army of Israel during the battle that day. 22-"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"23 The Israelites went to the LORD and cried until evening. They asked the LORD, “Should we go to fight the people of Benjamin again? They are our relatives.” The LORD answered, “Go fight against them.” The men of Israel encouraged each other. So they again went out to fight, as they had done the first day. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,24 Then the army of Israel came near the army of Benjamin. This was the second day of the war. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"25 The army of Benjamin came out of the city of Gibeah to attack the army of Israel on the second day. This time, the army of Benjamin killed another 18, 000 men from the army of Israel. All the men in the army of Israel were trained soldiers. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"26 Then all the Israelites went up to the city of Bethel. There they sat down and cried to the LORD. They did not eat anything all day, until evening. They also offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to the LORD. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,27 The men of Israel asked the LORD a question. (In those days God’s Box of the Agreement was there at Bethel. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"28 Phinehas was the priest who served God there. Phinehas was the son of Eleazar. Eleazar was the son of Aaron.) The Israelites asked, “The people of Benjamin are our relatives. Should we again go to fight against them? Or should we stop fighting?” The LORD answered, “Go. Tomorrow I will help you defeat them.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,29 Then the army of Israel hid some men all around the city of Gibeah. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,30 The army of Israel went to fight against the city of Gibeah on the third day. They got ready for battle as they had done before. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"31 The army of Benjamin came out of the city of Gibeah to fight the army of Israel. The army of Israel backed up and let the army of Benjamin chase them. In this way the army of Benjamin was tricked into leaving the city far behind them. The army of Benjamin began to kill some of the men in the army of Israel, as they had done before. They killed about  30 men from Israel. They killed some of them in the fields, and they killed some of them on the roads. One road led to the city of Bethel. The other road led to the city of Gibeah. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"32 The men of Benjamin said, “We are winning as before!” ‡ The men of Israel were running away, but it was a trick. They wanted to leadthe men of Benjamin away from their city and onto the roads. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"33 So all the men ran away. They stopped at a place named Baal Tamar. Some of the men of Israel were hiding west of Gibeah. They ran from their hiding places. 34 10,"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"34 10,"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,000 of Israel’s best-trained soldiers attacked the city of Gibeah. The fighting was very heavy. But the army of Benjamin did not know that a terrible thing was about to happen to them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"35 The LORD used the army of Israel and defeated the army of Benjamin. On that day the army of Israel killed 25,"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,100 soldiers from Benjamin. All of them had been trained for war. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,36 So the people of Benjamin saw that they were defeated. The army of Israel had moved back because they were depending on the surprise attack. They had men hiding near Gibeah. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,37 The men who were hiding rushed into the city of Gibeah. They spread out and killed everyone in the city with their swords. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,38 Now the men of Israel had made a plan with the men who were hiding. The men who were hiding were supposed to send a special signal. They were supposed to make a big cloud of smoke. 39-
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,41 The army of Benjamin had killed about 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"30 Israelite soldiers. So the men of Benjamin were saying, “We are winning, as before.” But then a big cloud of smoke began to rise from the city. The men of Benjamin turned around and saw the smoke. The whole city was on fire. Then the army of Israel stopped running away. They turned around and began to fight. The men of Benjamin were afraid because they knew that a terrible thing had happened to them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,42 So the army of Benjamin ran away from the army of Israel. They ran toward the desert. But they could not escape the fighting. And the men of Israel came out of the cities and killed them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,43 The men of Israel surrounded the men of Benjamin and began chasing them. They did not let them rest. They defeated them in the area east of Gibeah. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"44 So 18,"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,000 brave and strong fighters from the army of Benjamin were killed. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"45 The army of Benjamin turned around and ran toward the desert. They ran to a place called the Rock of Rimmon, but the army of Israel killed "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,5000 soldiers from Benjamin along the roads. They kept chasing the men of Benjamin. They chased them as far as a place named Gidom. The army of Israel killed 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,2000 more men from Benjamin in that place. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,"46 On that day 25, 000 men of the army of Benjamin were killed. All of them fought bravely with their swords. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,47 But  600 men from Benjamin ran into the desert to the place called the Rock of Rimmon and stayed there for four months. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,48 The men of Israel went back to the land of Benjamin. They killed the people and all the animals in every city. They destroyed everything they could find and burned every city they came to. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,19,21 Getting Wives for the Men of Benjamin 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,"1 At Mizpah, the men of Israel made a promise. This was their promise “Not one of us will let his daughter marry a man from the tribe of Benjamin.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,2 The Israelites went to the city of Bethel. There they sat before God until evening. They cried loudly as they sat there. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,"3 They said to God, “LORD, you are the God of the Israelites. Why has this terrible thing happened to us? Why has one tribe of the Israelites been taken away?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,"4 Early the next day, the Israelites built an altar. They put burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to God on that altar. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,"5 Then the Israelites said, “Are there any tribes of Israel who did not come here to meet with us before the LORD?”They asked this question because they had made a serious promise. They hadpromised that anyone who did not come together with the other tribes at the cityof Mizpah would be killed."
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,"6 Then the Israelites felt sorry for their relatives, the people of Benjamin. They said, “Today, one tribe has been separated from Israel. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,7 We made a promise with an oath before the LORD. We promised not to allow our daughters to marry a man from Benjamin. How can we make sure that the men of Benjamin will have wives?” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,"8 Then the Israelites asked, “Which one of the tribes of Israel did not come here to Mizpah? We have come together before the LORD. Surely one family was not here!” Then they found that no one from the city of Jabesh Gilead had met together with the other Israelites. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,9 The Israelites counted everyone to see who was there and who was not. They found that no one from Jabesh Gilead was there. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,"10 So the Israelites sent 12,"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,"000 soldiers to the city of Jabesh Gilead. They told the soldiers, “Go to Jabesh Gilead, and use your swords to kill everyone who lives there, even the women and children. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,11 You must do this! You must kill every man in Jabesh Gilead and every woman who has had sexual relations with a man. But do not kill any woman who has never had sex with a man.” So the soldiers did these things.* 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,"12 The 12,"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,000 soldiers found 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,400 young women in the city of Jabesh Gilead who had never had sex with a man. They brought these women to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,13 Then the Israelites sent a message to the men of Benjamin. They offered to make peace with the men of Benjamin. The men of Benjamin were at the place named the Rock of Rimmon. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,14 So the men of Benjamin came back to Israel. The Israelites gave them the women from Jabesh Gilead who they had not killed. But there were not enough women for all the men of Benjamin. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,15 The Israelites felt sorry for the men of Benjamin. They felt sorry for them because the LORD had separated them from the other tribes of Israel. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,"16 The elders of the Israelites said, “The women of the tribe of Benjamin have been killed. Where can we get wives for the men of Benjamin who are still alive? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,17 The men of Benjamin who are still alive must have children to continue their families. This must be done so that a tribe in Israel will not die out! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,18 But we cannot allow our daughters to marry the men of Benjamin. We have made this promise ‘Bad things will happen to anyone who gives a wife to a man of Benjamin.’ 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,19 We have an idea! This is the time for the festival of the LORD at the city of Shiloh. This festival is celebrated every year there.” (The city of Shiloh is north of the city of Bethel and east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem. And it is also to the south of the city of Lebonah.) 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,"20 So the elders told the men of Benjamin about their idea. They said, “Go and hide in the vineyards. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,21 Watch for the time during the festival when the young women from Shiloh come out to join the dancing. Then run out from where you are hiding in the vineyards. Each of you should take one of the young women from the city of Shiloh. Take them to the land of Benjamin and marry them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,"22 The fathers or brothers of the young women will come and complain to us. But we will say, ‘Be kind to the men of Benjamin. Let them marry the women. We could not get wives for each of them during the war. And you did not willingly give the women to the men of Benjamin, so you did not break your promise.’ ” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,"23 So that is what the men of the tribe of Benjamin did. While the young women were dancing, each man caught one of them. They took them away and married * them. Then they went back to their land. The men of Benjamin built cities againin that land, and they lived in them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,24 Then the Israelites went home. They went to their own land and tribe. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Judges,20,"25 In those days the Israelites did not have a king, so everyone did whatever they thought was right."

Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,1,1 Timothy 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,2,"1 Greetings from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus. I am an apostle by the command of God our Savior and Christ Jesus our hope. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,2,"2 To Timothy, a true son to me in the faith we share. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. Warnings Against False Teachings "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,2,"3 When I went to Macedonia, I asked you to stay in Ephesus. Some people there are teaching things that are not true, and I want you to tell them to stop. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,2,"4 Tell them not to give their time to meaningless stories and to long lists of names to prove their family histories. Such things only cause arguments. They don’t help God’s work, which is done only by faith. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,2,"5 My purpose in telling you to do this is to promote love—the kind of love shown by those whose thoughts are pure, who do what they know is right, and whose faith in God is real. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,2,6 But some have missed this key point in their teaching and have gone off in another direction. Now they talk about things that help no one. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,2,"7 They want to be teachers of the law,* but they don’t know what they are talking about. They don’t even understand the things they say they are sure of. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,2,8 We know that the law is good if someone uses it right. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,2,9 We also know that the law is not made for those who do what is right. It is made for those who are against the law and refuse to follow it. The law is for sinners who are against God and all that is pleasing to him. It is for those who have no interest in spiritual things and for those who kill their fathers or mothers or anyone else. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,2,"10 It is for those who commit sexual sins, homosexuals, those who sell slaves, those who tell lies, those who don’t tell the truth under oath, and those who are against the true teaching of God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,2,11 That teaching is part of the Good News that our blessed God gave me to tell. In it we see his glory. Thanks for God’s Mercy 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,2,12 I thank Christ Jesus our Lord because he trusted me and gave me this work of serving him. He gives me strength. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,2,"13 In the past I insulted Christ. As a proud and violent man, I persecuted his people. But God gave me mercy because I did not know what I was doing. I did that before I became a believer. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,2,14 But our Lord gave me a full measure of his grace. And with that grace came the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,2,"15 Here is a true statement that should be accepted without question Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, and I am the worst of them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,2,"16 But I was given mercy so that in me Christ Jesus could show that he has patience without limit. Christ showed his patience with me, the worst of all sinners. He wanted me to be an example for those who would believe in him and have eternal life. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,2,17 Honor and glory to the King who rules forever. He cannot be destroyed and cannot be seen. Honor and glory forever and ever to the only God. Amen. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,2,"18 Timothy, you are like a son to me. What I am telling you to do agrees with the prophecies† that were told about you in the past. I want you to remember those prophecies and fight the good fight of faith. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,2,"19 Continue to trust in God and do what you know is right. Some people have not done this, and their faith is now * in ruins. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,2,20 Hymenaeus and Alexander are men like that. I have given them to Satan so that they will learn not to speak against God. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,2,2 God Wants Us to Pray for Everyone 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,3,"1 First of all, I ask that you pray for all people. Ask God to bless them and give them what they need. And give thanks. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,3,2 You should pray for rulers and for all who have authority. Pray for these leaders so that we can live quiet and peaceful lives—lives full of devotion to God and respect for him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,3,3 This is good and pleases God our Savior. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,3,4 God wants everyone to be saved and to fully understand the truth. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,3,"5 There is only one God, and there is only one way that people can reach God. That way is through Christ Jesus, who as a man "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,3,6 gave himself to pay for everyone to be free. This is the message that was given to us at just the right time. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,3,7 And I was chosen as an apostle to tell people that message. (I am telling the truth. I am not lying.) I was chosen to teach those who are not Jews to believe and understand the truth. Special Instructions for Men and Women 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,3,8 I want the men everywhere to pray. Men who lift their hands in prayer must be devoted to God and pleasing to him. They must be men who keep themselves from getting angry and having arguments. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,3,9 And I want the women to make themselves attractive in the right way. Their clothes should be sensible and appropriate. They should not draw attention to themselves with fancy hairstyles or gold jewelry or pearls or expensive clothes. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,3,10 But they should make themselves attractive by the good things they do. That is more appropriate for women who say they are devoted to God. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,3,11 A woman should learn while listening quietly and being completely willing to obey. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,3,"12 I don’t allow a woman to teach a man or tell him what to do. She must listen quietly, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,3,13 because Adam was made first. Eve was made later. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,3,"14 Also, Adam was not the one who was tricked.* It was the woman who was tricked and became a sinner. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,3,"15 But women will be saved in their work of having children. They will be saved if they continue to live in faith, love, and holiness with sensible behavior. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,3,3 Leaders in the Church 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,4,1 It is a true statement that anyone whose goal is to serve as an elder* has his heart set on a good work. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,4,2 An elder† must be such a good man that no one can rightly criticize him. He must be faithful to his wife.‡ He must have self-control and be wise. He must be respected by others. He must be ready to help people by welcoming them into his home. He must be a good teacher. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,4,"3 He must not drink too much, and he must not be someone who likes to fight. He must be gentle and peaceful. He must not be someone who loves money. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,4,4 He must be a good leader of his own family. This means that his children obey him with full respect. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,4,"5 If a man does not know how to lead his own family, he will not be able to take care of God’s church. *"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,4,6 An elder must not be a new believer. It might make him too proud of himself. Then he would be condemned for his pride the same as the devil was. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,4,7 An elder must also have the respect of people who are not part of the church. Then he will not be criticized by others and be caught in the devil’s trap. Special Servants 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,4,"8 In the same way, the men who are chosen to be special servants must have the respect of others. They must not be men who say things they don’t mean or who spend their time drinking too much. They must not be men who will do almost anything for money. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,4,9 They must follow the true faith that God has now made known to us and always do what they know is right. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,4,"10 You should test them first. Then, if you find that they have done nothing wrong, they can be special servants. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,4,"11 In the same way, the women§ must have the respect of others. They must not be women who speak evil about other people. They must have self-control and be women who can be trusted in everything. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,4,12 The men who are special servants must be faithful in marriage.* They must be good leaders of children and their own families. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,4,13 Those who do well as special servants are making an honorable place for themselves. And they will feel very sure of their faith in Christ Jesus. The Secret of Our Life 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,4,"14 I hope I can come to you soon. But I am writing this to you now, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,4,"15 so that, even if I cannot come soon, you will know how people should live in the family† of God. That family is the church of the living God. And God’s church is the support and foundation of the truth. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,4,"16 Without a doubt, the secret of our life of worship is great Christ‡ was shown to us in human form; the Spirit proved that he was right; he was seen by angels. The message about him was told to the nations; people in the world believed in him; he was taken up to heaven in glory. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,4,4 A Warning About False Teachers 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,5,1 The Spirit clearly says that in the last times some will turn away from what we believe. They will obey spirits that tell lies. And they will follow the teachings of demons. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,5,2 Those teachings come through people who tell lies and trick others. These evil people cannot see what is right and what is wrong. It is like their conscience has been destroyed with a hot iron. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,5,"3 They say that it is wrong to marry. And they say that there are some foods that people must not eat. But God made these foods, and those who believe and who understand the truth can eat them with thanks. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,5,4 Everything that God made is good. Nothing he made should § be refused if it is accepted with thanks to him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,5,5 Everything he created is made holy by what he has said and by prayer. Be a Good Servant of Christ Jesus 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,5,6 Tell this to the brothers and sisters there. This will show that you are a good servant of Christ Jesus. You will show that you are made strong by the words of faith and good teaching you have followed. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,5,7 People tell silly stories that don’t agree with God’s truth. Don’t follow what these stories teach. But teach yourself to be devoted to God. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,5,8 Training your body helps you in some ways. But devotion to God helps you in every way. It brings you blessings in this life and in the future life too. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,5,9 Here is a true statement that should be accepted without question 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,5,"10 We hope in the living God, the Savior of all people. In particular, he is the Savior of all those who believe in him. This is why we work and struggle. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,5,11 Command and teach these things. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,5,"12 You are young, but don’t let anyone treat you as if you are not important. Be an example to show the believers how they should live. Show them by what you say, by the way you live, by your love, by your faith, and by your pure life. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,5,"13 Continue to read the Scriptures to the people, encourage them, and teach them. Do this until I come. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,5,"14 Remember to use the gift you have, which was given to you through a prophecy* when the group of elders laid their hands on you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,5,15 Continue to do these things. Give your life to doing them. Then everyone can see that your work is progressing. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,5,16 Be careful in your life and in your teaching. Continue to live and teach rightly. Then you will save yourself and those who listen to your teaching. 5 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,1 Don’t speak angrily to an older man. But talk to him as if he were your father. Treat the younger men like brothers. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,2 Treat the older women like mothers. And treat the younger women with respect like sisters. Taking Care of Widows 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,3 Take care of widows who really need help. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,"4 But if a widow has children or grandchildren, the first thing they need to learn is this to show their devotion to God by taking care of their own family. They will be repaying their parents, and this pleases God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,"5 A widow who really needs help is one who has been left all alone. She trusts God to take care of her. She prays all the time, night and day, and asks God for help. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,6 But the widow who uses her life to please herself is really dead while she is still living. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,7 Tell the believers there to take care of their family so that no one can say they are doing wrong. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,"8 Everyone should take care of all their own people. Most important, they should take care of their own family. If they do not do that, then they do not accept what we believe. They are worse than someone who does not even believe in God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,"9 To be added to your list of widows, a woman must be  60 years old or older. She must have been faithful to her husband.* "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,"10 She must be known for the good she has done raising children, welcoming travelers into her home, serving the needs† of God’s people, helping those in trouble, and using her life to do all kinds of good. *"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,"11 But don’t put younger widows on that list. When their strong physical needs pull them away from their commitment to Christ, they will want to marry again. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,12 Then they will be guilty of not doing what they first promised to do. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,"13 Also, these younger widows begin to waste their time going from house to house. They also begin to gossip and try to run other people’s lives. They say things they should not say. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,"14 So I want the younger widows to marry, have children, and take care of their homes. If they do this, our enemy will not have any reason to criticize them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,15 But some of the younger widows have already turned away to follow Satan. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,"16 If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family, she‡ should take care of them herself. Then the church will not have that burden and will be able to care for the widows who have no one else to help them. More About Elders and Other Matters "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,"17 The elders who lead the church in a good way should receive double honor§— in particular, those who do the work of counseling and teaching. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,"18 As the Scriptures say, “When a work animal is being used to separate grain, don’t keep it from eating the grain.”✡ And the Scriptures also say, “A worker should be given his pay.”✡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,19 Don’t listen to someone who accuses an elder. You should listen to them only if there are two or three others who can say what the elder did wrong. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,20 Tell those who sin that they are wrong. Do this in front of the whole church so that the others will have a warning. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,"21 Before God and Jesus Christ and the chosen angels, I tell you to make these judgments without any prejudice. Treat every person the same. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,22 Think carefully before you lay your hands on anyone to make him an elder. Don’t share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,"23 Timothy, stop drinking only water, and drink a little wine. This will help your stomach, and you will not be sick so often. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,24 The sins of some people are easy to see. Their sins show that they will be judged. But the sins of some others are seen only later. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,"25 It is the same with the good things people do. Some are easy to see. But even if they are not obvious now, none of them will stay hidden forever. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,6,6 Special Instructions for Slaves 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,7,1 All those who are slaves should show full respect to their masters. Then God’s name and our teaching will not be criticized. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,7,"2 Some slaves have masters who are believers, so they are brothers. Does this mean they should show their masters any less respect? No, they should serve them even better, because they are helping believers, people they should love. This is what you must teach and tell everyone to do. False Teaching and True Riches "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,7,3 Some people will teach what is false and will not agree with the true teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ. They will not accept the teaching that produces a life of devotion to God. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,7,"4 They are proud of what they know, but they understand nothing. They are sick with a love for arguing and fighting about words. And that brings jealousy, quarrels, insults, and evil mistrust. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,7,"5 They are always making ‡ trouble, because they are people whose thinking has been confused. They havelost their understanding of the truth. They think that devotion to God is a way toget rich."
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,7,"6 Devotion to God is, in fact, a way for people to be very rich, but only if it makes them satisfied with what they have. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,7,"7 When we came into the world, we brought nothing. And when we die, we can take nothing out. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,7,"8 So, if we have food and clothes, we will be satisfied with that. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,7,9 People who want to be rich bring temptations to themselves. They are caught in a trap. They begin to want many foolish things that will hurt them. These things ruin and destroy people. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,7,10 The love of money causes all kinds of evil. Some people have turned away from what we believe because they want to get more and more money. But they have caused themselves a lot of pain and sorrow. Some Things to Remember 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,7,"11 But you belong to God. So you should stay away from all those things. Always try to do what is right, to be devoted to God, and to have faith, love, patience, and gentleness. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,7,12 We have to fight to keep our faith. Try as hard as you can to win that fight. Take hold of eternal life. It is the life you were chosen to have when you confessed your faith in Jesus—that wonderful truth that you spoke so openly and that so many people heard. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,7,13 Before God and Christ Jesus I give you a command. Jesus is the one who confessed that same wonderful truth when he stood before Pontius Pilate. And God is the one who gives life to everything. Now I tell you this 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,7,14 Do what you were commanded to do without fault or blame until the time when our Lord Jesus Christ comes again. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,7,15 God will make that happen at the right time. God is the blessed and only Ruler. He is the King of all kings and the Lord of all lords. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,7,16 God is the only one who never dies. He lives in light so bright that people cannot go near it. No one has ever seen him; no one is able to see him. All honor and power belong to him forever. Amen. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,7,"17 Give this command to those who are rich with the things of this world. Tell them not to be proud. Tell them to hope in God, not their money. Money cannot be trusted, but God takes care of us richly. He gives us everything to enjoy. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,7,18 Tell those who are rich to do good—to be rich in good works. And tell them they should be happy to give and ready to share. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,7,"19 By doing this, they will be saving up a treasure for themselves. And that treasure will be a strong foundation on which their future life will be built. They will be able to have the life that is true life. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,7,"20 Timothy, God has trusted you with many things. Keep these things safe. Stay away from people who talk about useless things that are not from God and who argue against you with a “knowledge” that is not knowledge at all. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Timothy,7,21 Some people who claim to have that “knowledge” have gone completely away from what we believe. God’s grace be with you all.

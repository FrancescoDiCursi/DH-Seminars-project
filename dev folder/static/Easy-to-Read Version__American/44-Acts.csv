Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,1,21 And everyone who trusts in the Lord† will be saved.’ Joel David was talking about the Messiah rising from death.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,1,"4 Peter and John looked at the crippled man and said, “Look at us!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,1,5 He looked at them; he thought they would give him some money.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,1,7 Then Peter took the man’s right hand and lifted him up. Immediately his feet and legs became strong. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,1,"8 He jumped up, stood on his feet, and began to walk. He went into the Temple area with them. He was walking and jumping and praising God. 9-"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,1,10 All the people recognized him. They knew he was the crippled man who always sat by the Beautiful Gate to beg for money.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,1,11 The man was holding on to Peter and John. All the people were amazed. They ran to Peter and John at Solomon’s Porch. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,1,"12 When Peter saw this, he said to the people, “My Jewish brothers, why are you surprised at this? You are looking at us as if it was our power that made this man walk. Do you think this was done because we are good? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,1,"13 No, God did it! He is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. He is the God of all our fathers. He gave glory to Jesus, his special servant. But you handed him over to be killed. Pilate decided to let him go free. But you told Pilate you did not want him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,1,"14 Jesus was holy and good, but you said you did not want him. You told Pilate to give you a murderer* instead of Jesus. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,1,15 And so you killed the one who gives life! But God raised him from death. We are witnesses of this—we saw it with our own eyes.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,1,18 But God said these things would happen. Through the prophets he said that his Messiah would suffer and die. I have told you how God made this happen. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,1,"19 So you must change your hearts and lives. Come back to God, and he will forgive your sins. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,1,"20 Then the Lord will give you times of spiritual rest. He will send you Jesus, the one he chose to be the Messiah. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,1,21 “But Jesus must stay in heaven until the time when all things will be made right again. God told about this time when he spoke long ago through his holy prophets. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,1,"22 Moses said, ‘The Lord your God will give you a prophet. That prophet will come from among your own people. He will be like me. You must obey everything he tells you. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,1,"24 “Samuel, and all the other prophets who spoke for God after Samuel, said that this time would come. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"1 While Peter and John were speaking to the people, some Jewish leaders came up to them. There were some priests, the captain of the soldiers that guarded the Temple, and some Sadducees. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"2 They were upset because of what Peter and John were teaching the people. By telling people about Jesus, the apostles were teaching that people will rise from death. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"3 The Jewish leaders arrested Peter and John and put them in jail. It was already night, so they kept them in jail until the next day. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,4 But many of the people who heard the apostles believed what they said. There were now about  5000 men in the group of believers. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"5 The next day the Jewish rulers, the older Jewish leaders, and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"6 Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, and Alexander were there. Everyone from the high priest’s family was there. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"7 They made Peter and John stand before all the people. They asked them over and over, “How did you make this crippled man well? What power did you use? By whose authority did you do this?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"8 Then Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit and said to them, “Rulers of the people and you older leaders, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,9 are you questioning us today about what we did to help this crippled man? Are you asking us what made him well? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"10 We want all of you and all the people of Israel to know that this man was made well by the power of Jesus Christ from Nazareth. You nailed Jesus to a cross, but God raised him from death. This man was crippled, but he is now well. He is able to stand here before you because of the power of Jesus! "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,11 Jesus is ‘the stone* that you builders thought was not important. But this stone has become the cornerstone.’ Psalm from God.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"24 When the believers heard this, they all prayed to God with one purpose. They said, “Master, you are the one who made the sky, the earth, the sea, and everything in the world. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"25 Our ancestor David was your servant. With the help of the Holy Spirit he wrote these words ‘Why are the nations shouting?

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"26 ‘The kings of the earth prepare themselves to fight, and the rulers all come together against the Lord and against his Messiah.’ Psalm"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"4 Before you sold the field, it belonged to you, right? And even after you sold it, you could have used the money any way you wanted. How could you even think of doing such a thing? You lied to God, not to us!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"5-6 When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. Some young men came and wrapped his body. They carried it out and buried it. And everyone who heard about this was filled with fear. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,7 About three hours later his wife came in. Sapphira did not know about what had happened to her husband. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"8 Peter said to her, “Tell me how much money you got for your field. Was it this much?” Sapphira answered, “Yes, that was all we got for the field.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"9 Peter said to her, “Why did you and your husband agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! Do you hear those footsteps? The men who buried your husband are at the door. They will carry you out in the same way.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,10 At that moment Sapphira fell down by his feet and died. The young men came in and saw that she was dead. They carried her out and buried her beside her husband. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,11 The whole church and all the other people who heard about this were filled with fear. Proofs From God 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"12 The apostles were given the power to do many miraculous signs and wonders among the people. They were together in Solomon’s Porch, and they all had the same purpose. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"13 None of the other people dared to stand with the apostles, but everyone was saying wonderful things about them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"14 More and more people believed in the Lord, and many men and women were added to the group of believers. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,15 So the people brought those who were sick into the streets and put them on little beds and mats. They were hoping that Peter’s shadow might fall on them as he walked by. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,16 People came from all the towns around Jerusalem. They brought those who were sick or troubled by evil spirits. All of them were healed. The Apostles Are Arrested 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"17 The high priest and all his friends, a group called the Sadducees, became very jealous. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,18 They grabbed the apostles and put them in jail. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"19 But during the night, an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail. The angel led the apostles outside and said, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,20 “Go and stand in the Temple area. Tell the people everything about this new life.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"21 When the apostles heard this, they did what they were told. They went into the Temple area about sunrise and began to teach the people. The high priest and his friends came together and called a meeting of the high council and all the older Jewish leaders. They sent some men to the jail to bring the apostles to them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"22 When the men went to the jail, they could not find the apostles there. So they went back and told the Jewish leaders about this. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"23 They said, “The jail was closed and locked. The guards were standing at the doors. But when we opened the doors, the jail was empty!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,24 The captain of the Temple guards and the leading priests heard this. They were confused and wondered what it all meant. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"25 Then another man came and told them, “Listen! The men you put in jail are standing in the Temple area teaching the people.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"26 The captain and his men went out and brought the apostles back. But the soldiers did not use force, because they were afraid of the people. They were afraid the people would stone them to death. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,27 The soldiers brought the apostles in and made them stand before the council. The high priest questioned them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"28 He said, “We told you never again to teach using that name.* But look at what you have done! You have filled Jerusalem withyour teaching. And you are trying to blame us for his death.”"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"29 Peter and the other apostles answered, “We must obey God, not you! "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"30 You killed Jesus by nailing him to a cross. But God, the same God our fathers had, raised Jesus up from death. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,31 Jesus is the one God honored by giving him a place at his right side. He made him our Leader and Savior. God did this to give all the people of Israel the opportunity to change and turn to God to have their sins forgiven. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"32 We saw all these things happen, and we can say that they are true. The Holy Spirit also shows that these things are true. God has given this Spirit to all those who obey him.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"33 When the council members heard this, they became very angry. They began to plan a way to kill the apostles. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"34 But one member of the council, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, stood up. He was a teacher of the law, and all the people respected him. He told the men to make the apostles leave the meeting for a few minutes. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"35 Then he said to them, “Men of Israel, be careful of what you are planning to do to these men. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"36 Remember when Theudas appeared? He said he was an important man, and about  400 men joined him. But he was killed, and all who followed him were scattered and ran away. They were not able to do anything. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"37 Later, during the time of the census, a man named Judas came from Galilee. Many people joined his group, but he was also killed, and all his followers were scattered. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"38 And so now I tell you, stay away from these men. Leave them alone. If their plan is something they thought up, it will fail. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,"39 But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop them. You might even be fighting against God himself!” The Jewish leaders agreed with what Gamaliel said. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,40 They called the apostles in again. They beat them and told them not to speak anymore using the name of Jesus. Then they let them go free. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,41 The apostles left the council meeting. They were happy because they were given the honor of suffering dishonor for Jesus. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,42 The apostles did not stop teaching the people. They continued to tell the Good News—that Jesus is the Messiah. They did this every day in the Temple area and in people’s homes. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,2,6 Seven Men Chosen for a Special Work 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,3,"1 More and more people were becoming followers of Jesus.

They said that their widows were not getting their share of what the followers received every day. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,3,"2 The twelve apostles called the whole group of followers together. The apostles said to them, “It would not be right for us to give up our work of teaching God’s word in order to be in charge of getting food to people. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,3,"3 So, brothers and sisters, choose seven of your men who have a good reputation. They must be full of wisdom and the Spirit. We will give them this work to do. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,3,4 Then we can use all our time to pray and to teach the word of God.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,3,"5 The whole group liked the idea. So they chose these seven men Stephen (a man with great faith and full of the Holy Spirit), Philip,* Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus (a man from Antioch who had become a Jew). *"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,3,"6 Then they put these men before the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,3,7 The word of God was reaching more and more people. The group of followers in Jerusalem became larger and larger. Even a big group of Jewish priests believed and obeyed. Some Jews Against Stephen 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,3,8 Stephen received a great blessing. God gave him power to do great wonders and miraculous signs among the people. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,3,"9 But some of the Jews there were from the synagogue of Free Men, as it was called. The group included Jews from Cyrene, Alexandria, Cilicia, and Asia. They started arguing with Stephen. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,3,10 But the Spirit was helping him speak with wisdom. His words were so strong that these Jews could not argue with him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,3,"11 So they told some men to say, “We heard Stephen say bad things against Moses and against God!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,3,"12 By doing this, these Jews upset the people, the older Jewish leaders, and the teachers of the law. They became so angry that they came and grabbed Stephen and took him to a meeting of the high council. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,3,"13 The Jews brought some men into the meeting to tell lies about Stephen. These men said, “This man is always saying things against this holy place and against the Law of Moses. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,3,14 We heard him say that Jesus from Nazareth will destroy this place and change what Moses told us to do.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,3,15 Everyone there in the council meeting was staring at Stephen. They saw that his face looked like the face of an angel. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,3,7 Stephen’s Speech 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,"1 The high priest said to Stephen, “Is all this true?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,"2 Stephen answered, “My Jewish fathers and brothers, listen to me. Our great and glorious God appeared to Abraham, our ancestor, when he was in Mesopotamia. This was before he lived in Haran. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,"3 God said to him, ‘Leave your country and your people, and go to the country I will show you.’✡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,"4 “So Abraham left the country of Chaldea.* He went to live in Haran. After his father died, God sent him to this place, where you live now. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,"5 But God did not give Abraham any of this land, not even a foot of it. But God promised that in the future he would give Abraham this land for himself and for his children. This was before Abraham had any children. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,6 “This is what God said to him ‘Your descendants will live in another country. They will be strangers. The people there will make them slaves and mistreat them for  400 years. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,"7 But I will punish the nation that made them slaves.’✡ And God also said, ‘After those things happen, your people will come out of that country. Then they will worship me here in this place.’✡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,"8 “God made an agreement with Abraham; the sign for this agreement was circumcision. And so when Abraham had a son, he circumcised him when he was eight days old. His son’s name was Isaac. Isaac also circumcised his son Jacob. And Jacob did the same for his sons, who became the twelve great ancestors of our people. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,9 “These ancestors of ours became jealous of their brother Joseph and sold him to be a slave in Egypt. But God was with him 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,10 and saved him from all his ✡ troubles. Pharaoh was the king of Egypt then. He liked Joseph and respectedhim because of the wisdom God gave him. Pharaoh gave Joseph the job of beinga governor of Egypt. He even let him rule over all the people in Pharaoh’s house.
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,"11 But all the land of Egypt and of Canaan became dry. It became so dry that food could not grow, and the people suffered very much. Our people could not find anything to eat. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,12 “But Jacob heard that there was food in Egypt. So he sent our people there. This was their first trip to Egypt. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,13 Then they went there a second time. This time Joseph told his brothers who he was. And Pharaoh learned about Joseph’s family. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,"14 Then Joseph sent some men to tell Jacob, his father, to come to Egypt. He also invited all his relatives, a total of  75 people. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,15 So Jacob went down to Egypt. He and our other ancestors lived there until they died. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,"16 Later, their bodies were moved to Shechem, where they were put in a tomb. It was the same tomb that Abraham had bought in Shechem from the sons of Hamor. He paid them with silver. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,17 “The number of our people in Egypt grew. There were more and more of our people there. The promise that God made to Abraham was soon to come true. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,"18 Then a different king began to rule Egypt, one who knew nothing about Joseph. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,"19 This king tricked our people. He treated them badly, making them leave their children outside to die. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,"20 “This was the time when Moses was born. He was a very beautiful child, and for three months his parents took care of him at home. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,"21 When they put him outside, Pharaoh’s daughter took him. She raised him as her own son. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,22 The Egyptians taught Moses everything they knew. He was powerful in all he said and did. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,"23 “When Moses was about  40 years old, he decided to visit his own people, the people of Israel. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,"24 He saw one of them being mistreated by an Egyptian, so he defended him. Moses hit the Egyptian to pay him back for hurting the man. He hit him so hard that it killed him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,25 Moses thought that his people would understand that God was using him to save them. But they did not understand. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,"26 “The next day, Moses saw two of his own people fighting. He tried to make peace between them. He said, ‘Men, you are brothers! Why are you trying to hurt each other?’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,"27 The man who was hurting the other one pushed Moses away and said to him, ‘Did anyone say you could be our ruler and judge? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,28 Will you kill me just as you killed that Egyptian yesterday?’✡ 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,"29 When Moses heard him say this, he left Egypt. He went to live in the land of Midian, where he was a stranger. During the time he lived there, he had two sons. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,30 “Forty years later Moses was in the desert near Mount Sinai. An angel appeared to him in the flame of a burning bush. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,"31 When Moses saw this, he was amazed. He went near to look closer at it. He heard a voice; it was the Lord’s. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,"32 The Lord said, ‘I am the same God your ancestors had—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’✡ Moses began to shake with fear. He was afraid to look at the bush. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,4,"33 “The Lord said to him, ‘Take off your sandals, because the place where you are now standing is holy ground. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,10,"10 and said, “You son of the devil, full of lies and all kinds of evil tricks! You are an enemy of everything that is right. Will you never stop trying to change the Lord’s truths into lies? "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,10,51 So Paul and Barnabas shook the dust off their feet.‡ Then they went to the city of Iconium. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,10,52 But the Lord’s followers in Antioch were happy and filled with the Holy Spirit. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,10,14 Paul and Barnabas in Iconium 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,"1 Paul and Barnabas went to the city of Iconium. As they did in Antioch, they entered the Jewish synagogue. They spoke to the people there. They spoke so well that many Jews and Greeks believed what they said. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,2 But some of the Jews did not believe. They said things that caused the non-Jewish people to be angry and turn against the believers. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,"3 So Paul and Barnabas stayed in Iconium a long time, and they spoke bravely for the Lord. They told the people about God’s grace. The Lord proved that what they said was true by causing miraculous signs and wonders to be done through them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,4 But some of the people in the city agreed with the Jews who did not believe Paul and Barnabas. Others followed the apostles. So the city was divided. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,"5 Some of the Jews there, as well as their leaders and some of the non-Jewish people, were determined to hurt Paul and Barnabas. They wanted to stone them to death. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,"6 When Paul and Barnabas learned about this, they left the city. They went to Lystra and Derbe, cities in Lycaonia, and to the surrounding areas. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,7 They told the Good News there too. Paul in Lystra and Derbe 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,8 In Lystra there was a man who had something wrong with his feet. He had been born crippled and had never walked. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,9 He was sitting and listening to Paul speak. Paul looked straight at him and saw that the man believed God could heal him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,"10 So Paul shouted, “Stand up on your feet!” The man jumped up and began walking around. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,"11 When the people saw what Paul did, they shouted in their own Lycaonian language. They said, “The gods have come down to us in the form of humans!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,"12 The people began to call Barnabas “Zeus,” and they called Paul “Hermes,” because he was the main speaker. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,13 The temple of Zeus was near the city. The priest of this temple brought some bulls and flowers to the city gates. The priest and the people wanted to offer a sacrifice to Paul and Barnabas. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,"14 But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, understood what the people were doing, they tore their own clothes.* Then they ran in among the people and shouted to them "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,"15 “Men, why are you doing this? We are not gods. We are human just like you. We came to tell you the Good News. We are telling you to turn away from these worthless things. Turn to the true living God, the one who made the sky, the earth, the sea, and everything that is in them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,16 “In the past God let all the nations do what they wanted. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,17 But God was always there doing the good things that prove he is real. He gives you rain from heaven and good harvests at the right times. He gives you plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,"18 Even after saying all this, Paul and Barnabas still could hardly stop the people from offering sacrifices to them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,19 Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and persuaded the people to turn against Paul. So they threw stones at him and dragged him out of the ‡ town. They thought they had killed him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,"20 But when the followers of Jesus gathered around him, he got up and went back into the town. The next day he and Barnabas left and went to the city of Derbe. The Return to Antioch in Syria "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,"21 They also told the Good News in the city of Derbe, and many people became followers of Jesus. Then Paul and Barnabas returned to the cities of Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,"22 In those cities they helped the followers grow stronger in their faith and encouraged them to continue trusting God. They told them, “We must suffer many things on our way into God’s kingdom.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,"23 They also chose elders for each church and stopped eating for a period of time to pray for them. These elders were men who had put their trust in the Lord Jesus, so Paul and Barnabas put them in his care. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,24 Paul and Barnabas went through the country of Pisidia. Then they came to the country of Pamphylia. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,"25 They told people the message of God in the city of Perga, and then they went down to the city of Attalia. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,26 And from there they sailed away to Antioch in Syria. This is the city where the believers had put them into God’s care and sent them to do this work. Now they had finished it. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,"27 When Paul and Barnabas arrived, they gathered the church together. They told them everything God had used them to do. They said, “God opened a door for the non-Jewish people to believe!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,28 And they stayed there a long time with the Lord’s followers. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,11,15 The Meeting at Jerusalem 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,1 Then some men came to Antioch from Judea and began teaching the non- Jewish believers “You cannot be saved if you are not circumcised as Moses taught us.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,"2 Paul and Barnabas were against this teaching and argued with these men about it. So the group decided to send Paul, Barnabas, and some others to Jerusalem to talk more about this with the apostles and elders. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,"3 The church helped them get ready to leave on their trip. The men went through the countries of Phoenicia and Samaria, where they told all about how the non-Jewish people had turned to the true God. This made all the believers very happy. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,"4 When the men arrived in Jerusalem, the apostles, the elders, and the whole church welcomed them. Paul, Barnabas, and the others told about all that God had done with them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,"5 Some of the believers in Jerusalem had belonged to the Pharisees. They stood up and said, “The non-Jewish believers must be circumcised. We must tell them to obey the Law of Moses!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,6 Then the apostles and the elders gathered to study this problem. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,"7 After a long debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “My brothers, I am sure you remember what happened in the early days. God chose me from among you to tell the Good News to those who are not Jewish. It was from me that they heard the Good News and believed. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,"8 God knows everyone, even their thoughts, and he accepted these non-Jewish people. He showed this to us by giving them the Holy Spirit the same as he did to us. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,"9 To God, those people are not different from us. When they believed, God made their hearts pure. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,"10 So now, why are you putting a heavy burden* around the necks of the non-Jewish followers of Jesus? Are you trying to make God angry? We and our fathers were not able to carry that burden. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,"11 No, * we believe that we and these people will be saved the same way—by the graceof the Lord Jesus.”"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,12 Then the whole group became quiet. They listened while Paul and Barnabas told about all the miraculous signs and wonders that God had done through them among the non-Jewish people. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,"13 When they finished speaking, James said, “My brothers, listen to me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,"14 Simon Peter has told us how God showed his love for the non-Jewish people. For the first time, God accepted them and made them his people. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,15 The words of the prophets agree with this too 16 ‘I will return after this. I will build David’s house again. It has fallen down. I will build again the parts of his house that have been pulled down. I will make his house new. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,16 ‘I will return after this. I will build David’s house again. It has fallen down. I will build again the parts of his house that have been pulled down. I will make his house new.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,"28 We agree with the Holy Spirit that you should have no more burdens, except for these necessary things "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,"29 Don’t eat food that has been given to idols. Don’t eat meat from animals that have been strangled or any meat that still has the blood in it. Don’t be involved in sexual sin. If you stay away from these, you will do well. We say goodbye now. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,"30 So Paul, Barnabas, Judas, and Silas left Jerusalem and went to Antioch. There they gathered the group of believers together and gave them the letter. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,"31 When the believers read it, they were happy. The letter comforted them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,"32 Judas and Silas, who were also prophets, said many things to encourage the believers and make them stronger in their faith. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,"33 After Judas and Silas stayed there for a while, they left. They received a blessing of peace from the believers. Then they went back to those who had sent them. 34 ‡ "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,37 Barnabas wanted to bring John Mark with them too. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,38 But on their first trip John Mark did not continue with them in the work. He had left them at Pamphylia. So Paul did not think it was a good idea to take him this time. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,39 Paul and Barnabas had a big argument about this. It was so bad that they separated and went different ways. Barnabas sailed to Cyprus and took Mark with him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,40 Paul chose Silas to go with him. The believers in Antioch put Paul into the Lord’s care and sent him out. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,"41 Paul and Silas went through the countries of Syria and Cilicia, helping the churches grow stronger. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,12,16 Timothy Goes With Paul and Silas 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"1 Paul went to the city of Derbe and then to Lystra, where a follower of Jesus named Timothy lived. Timothy’s mother was a Jewish believer, but his father was a Greek. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,2 The believers in the cities of Lystra and Iconium had only good things to say about him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"3 Paul wanted Timothy to travel with him, but all the Jews living in that area knew that his father was a Greek. So Paul circumcised Timothy to please the Jews. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,4 Then Paul and those with him traveled through other cities. They gave the believers the rules and decisions from the apostles and elders in Jerusalem. They told them to obey these rules. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"5 So the churches were becoming stronger in their faith, and the number of believers was growing every day. Paul Is Called to Macedonia "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,6 Paul and those with him went through the areas of Phrygia and Galatia because the Holy Spirit did not allow them to tell the Good News in the province of ‡ Asia. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"7 When they reached the border of Mysia, they tried to go on into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not let them go there. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,8 So they passed by Mysia and went to the city of Troas. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"9 That night Paul saw a vision. In it, a man from Macedonia came to Paul. The man stood there and begged, “Come across to Macedonia and help us.” "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"14 There was a woman there named Lydia from the city of Thyatira. Her job was selling purple cloth. She was a worshiper of the true God. Lydia was listening to Paul, and the Lord opened her heart to accept what Paul was saying. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"15 She and all the people living in her house were baptized. Then she invited us into her home. She said, “If you think I am a true believer in the Lord Jesus, come stay in my house.” She persuaded us to stay with her. Paul and Silas in Jail "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"16 One day we were going to the place for prayer, and a servant girl met us. She had a spirit† in her that gave her the power to tell what would happen in the future. By doing this she earned a lot of money for the men who owned her. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"17 She started following Paul and the rest of us around. She kept shouting, “These men are servants of the Most High God! They are telling you how you can be saved!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"18 She continued doing this for many days. This bothered Paul, so he turned and said to the spirit, “By the power of Jesus Christ, I command you to come out of her!” Immediately, the spirit came out. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"19 When the men who owned the servant girl saw this, they realized that they could no longer use her to make money. So they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them to the public square to meet with the authorities. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"20 They brought Paul and Silas before the Roman officials and said, “These men are Jews, and they are making trouble in our city. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,21 They are telling people to do things that are not right for us as Romans to do.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,22 The whole crowd turned against Paul and Silas. The officials tore the clothes off both men and ordered that they be beaten with rods. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"23 They were beaten severely and thrown into jail. The officials told the jailer, “Guard them very carefully!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"24 When the jailer heard this special order, he put Paul and Silas far inside the jail and bound their feet between large blocks of wood. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,25 About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing songs to God. The other prisoners were listening to them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"26 Suddenly there was an earthquake so strong that it shook the foundation of the jail. All the doors of the jail opened, and the chains on all the prisoners fell off. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"27 The jailer woke up and saw that the jail doors were open. He thought that the prisoners had already escaped, so * he got his sword and was ready to kill himself.‡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"28 But Paul shouted, “Don’t hurt yourself! We are all here!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"29 The jailer told someone to bring a light. Then he ran inside and, shaking with fear, fell down in front of Paul and Silas. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"30 Then he brought them outside and said, “Men, what must I do to be saved?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"31 They said to him, “Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved—you and all who live in your house.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,32 So Paul and Silas told the message of the Lord to the jailer and all the people who lived in his house. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"33 It was late at night, but the jailer took Paul and Silas and washed their wounds. Then the jailer and all his people were baptized. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,34 After this the jailer took Paul and Silas home and gave them some food. All the people were very happy because they now believed in God. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"35 The next morning the Roman officials sent some soldiers to tell the jailer, “Let these men go free.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"36 The jailer said to Paul, “The officials have sent these soldiers to let you go free. You can leave now. Go in peace.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"37 But Paul said to the soldiers, “Those officials did not prove that we did anything wrong, but they beat us in public and put us in jail. And we are Roman citizens.§ Now they want us to go away quietly. No, they must come here themselves and lead us out!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"38 The soldiers told the officials what Paul said. When they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were afraid. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,39 So they came and told them they were sorry. They led them out of the jail and asked them to leave the city. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,"40 But when Paul and Silas came out of the jail, they went to Lydia’s house. They saw some of the believers there and encouraged them. Then they left. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,13,17 Paul and Silas in Thessalonica 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"1 Paul and Silas traveled through the cities of Amphipolis and Apollonia. They came to the city of Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"2 Paul went into the synagogue to see the Jews as he always did. The next three weeks, on each Sabbath day, he discussed the Scriptures with them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"3 He explained the Scriptures to show them that the Messiah had to die and then rise from death. He said, “This Jesus that I am telling you about is the Messiah.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"4 Some of the Jews there believed Paul and Silas and decided to join them. Also, a large number of Greeks who were worshipers of the true God and many important women joined them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"5 But the Jews who did not believe became jealous, so they got some bad men from around the city center to make trouble. They formed a mob and caused a riot in the city. They went to Jason’s house, looking for Paul and Silas. They wanted to bring them out before the people. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"6 When they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the other believers to the city leaders. The people shouted, “These men have made trouble everywhere in the world, and now they have come here too! "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,7 Jason is keeping them in his house. They all do things against the laws of Caesar. They say there is another king called Jesus.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"8 When the city leaders and the other people heard this, they became very upset. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,9 They made Jason and the other believers deposit money to guarantee that there would be no more trouble. Then they let them go. ‡ Paul and Silas Go to Berea
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"10 That same night the believers sent Paul and Silas to another city named Berea. When they arrived there, they went to the Jewish synagogue. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,11 The people in Berea were more open-minded than those in Thessalonica. They were so glad to hear the message Paul told them. They studied the Scriptures every day to make sure that what they heard was really true. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"12 The result was that many of them believed, including many important Greek women and men. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"13 But when the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was telling people God’s message in Berea, they came there too. They upset the people and made trouble. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"14 So the believers immediately sent Paul away to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed in Berea. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,15 Those who went with Paul took him to the city of Athens. They returned with a message for Silas and Timothy to come and join him as soon as they could. Paul in Athens 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"16 While Paul was waiting for Silas and Timothy in Athens, he was upset because he saw that the city was full of idols. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,17 In the synagogue he talked with the Jews and with the Greeks who were worshipers of the true God. He also went to the public square every day and talked with everyone who came by. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"18 Some of the Epicurean and some of the Stoic philosophers argued with him. Some of them said, “This man doesn’t really know what he is talking about. What is he trying to say?” Paul was telling them the Good News about Jesus and the resurrection. So they said, “He seems to be telling us about some other gods.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"19 They took Paul to a meeting of the Areopagus council. They said, “Please explain to us this new idea that you have been teaching. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"20 The things you are saying are new to us. We have never heard this teaching before, and we want to know what it means.” 21 (The people of Athens and the foreigners who lived there spent all their time either telling or listening to all the latest ideas.) "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,21 (The people of Athens and the foreigners who lived there spent all their time either telling or listening to all the latest ideas.) 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"22 Then Paul stood up before the meeting of the Areopagus council and said, “Men of Athens, everything I see here tells me you are very religious. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,23 I was going through your city and I saw the things you worship. I found an altar that had these words written on it ‘to an unknown god.’ You worship a god that you don’t know. This is the God I want to tell you about. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,24 “He is the God who made the whole world and everything in it. He is the Lord of the land and the sky. He does not live in temples built by human hands. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"25 He is the one who gives people life, breath, and everything else they need. He does not need any help from them. He has everything he needs. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"26 God began by making one man, and from him he made all the different people who live everywhere in the world. He decided exactly when and where they would live. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"27 “God wanted people to look for him, and perhaps in searching all around for him, they would find him. But he is not far from any of us. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"28 It is through him that we are able to live, to do what we do, and to be who we are. As your own poets have said, ‘We all come from him.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"29 “That’s right. We all come from God. So you must not think that he is like something people imagine or make. He is not made of gold, silver, or stone. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"30 In the past people did not understand God, and he overlooked this. But now he is telling everyone in the world to change and turn to him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,31 He has decided on a day when he will judge all the people in the world in a way that is fair. To do this he will use a man he chose long ago. And he has proved to everyone that this is the man to do it. He proved it by raising him from death!”
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"32 When the people heard about Jesus being raised from death, some of them laughed. But others said, “We will hear more about this from you later.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,33 So Paul left the council meeting. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,"34 But some of the people joined with Paul and became believers. Among these were Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus council, a woman named Damaris, and some others. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,14,18 Paul in Corinth 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"1 Later, Paul left Athens and went to the city of Corinth. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"2 There he met a Jewish man named Aquila, who was born in the country of Pontus. But he and his wife, Priscilla, had recently moved to Corinth from Italy. They left Italy because Claudius had given an order for all Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to visit Aquila and Priscilla. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"3 They were tentmakers, the same as Paul, so he stayed with them and worked with them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"4 Every Sabbath day Paul went to the synagogue and talked with both Jews and Greeks, trying to persuade them to believe in Jesus. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"5 But after Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul spent all his time telling God’s message to the Jews, trying to convince them that Jesus is the Messiah. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"6 But they disagreed with what Paul was teaching and started insulting him. So Paul shook the dust from his clothes.* He said to them, “If you are not saved, it will be your own fault! I have done all I can do. After this I will go only to the non-Jewish people.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"7 Paul left the synagogue and moved into the home of Titius Justus, a man who was a worshiper of the true God. His house was next to the synagogue. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"8 Crispus was the leader of that synagogue. He and all the people living in his house believed in the Lord Jesus. Many other people in Corinth also listened to Paul. They, too, believed and were baptized. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"9 During the night, Paul had a vision. The Lord said to him, “Don’t be afraid, and don’t stop talking to people. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"10 I am with you, and no one will be able to hurt you. Many of my people are in this city.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,11 Paul stayed there for a year and a half teaching God’s message to the people. Paul Is Brought Before Gallio 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"12 During the time that Gallio was the governor of Achaia, some of the Jews came together against Paul. They took him to court. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"13 They said to Gallio, “This man is teaching people to worship God in a way that is against our law!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"14 Paul was ready to say something, but Gallio spoke to the Jews. He said, “I would listen to you if your complaint was about a crime or other wrong. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,15 But it is only about words and names—arguments about your own law. So you must solve this problem yourselves. I don’t want to be a judge of these matters.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,16 So Gallio made them leave the court. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"17 Then they all grabbed Sosthenes, the leader of the synagogue. They beat him before the court. But this did not bother Gallio. Paul Returns to Antioch "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"18 Paul stayed with the believers for many days. Then he left and sailed for Syria. Priscilla and Aquila were also with him. At Cenchrea Paul cut off his hair,† because he had made a promise to God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"19 Then they went to the city of Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. While Paul was in Ephesus, he went into the synagogue and talked with the Jews. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"20 They asked him to stay longer, but he * refused. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"21 He left them and said, “I will come back to you again if God wants me to.” And so he sailed away from Ephesus. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"22 When Paul arrived at Caesarea, he went to Jerusalem and visited the church there. After that he went to Antioch. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"23 Paul stayed in Antioch for a while. Then he left there and went through the countries of Galatia and Phrygia.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"24 A Jew named Apollos came to Ephesus. Born in the city of Alexandria, he was an educated man who knew the Scriptures well. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"25 He had been taught about the Lord and was always excited‡ to talk to people about Jesus. What he taught was right, but the only baptism he knew about was the baptism that John taught. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"26 Apollos began to speak very boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him speak, they took him to their home and helped him understand the way of God better. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,"27 Apollos wanted to go to Achaia. So the believers in Ephesus helped him. They wrote a letter to the Lord’s followers in Achaia and asked them to accept Apollos. When he arrived there, he was a great help to those who had believed in Jesus because of God’s grace. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,28 He argued very strongly against the Jews before all the people. He clearly proved that the Jews were wrong. He used the Scriptures and showed that Jesus is the Messiah. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,15,19 Paul in Ephesus 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"1 While Apollos was in the city of Corinth, Paul was visiting some places on his way to Ephesus. In Ephesus he found some other followers of the Lord. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"2 He asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” These followers said to him, “We have never even heard of a Holy Spirit!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"3 Paul asked them, “So what kind of baptism did you have?” They said, “It was the baptism that John taught.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"4 Paul said, “John told people to be baptized to show they wanted to change their lives. He told people to believe in the one who would come after him, and that one is Jesus.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"5 When these followers heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"6 Then Paul laid his hands on them, and the Holy Spirit came on them. They began speaking different languages and prophesying. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,7 There were about twelve men in this group. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"8 Paul went into the synagogue and spoke very boldly. He continued doing this for three months. He talked with the Jews, trying to persuade them to accept what he was telling them about God’s kingdom. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"9 But some of them became stubborn and refused to believe. In front of everyone, they said bad things about the Way. So Paul left these Jews and took the Lord’s followers with him. He went to a place where a man named Tyrannus had a school. There Paul talked with people every day. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"10 He did this for two years. Because of this work, everyone in Asia, Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord. The Sons of Sceva ‡"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,11 God used Paul to do some very special miracles. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"12 Some people carried away handkerchiefs and clothes that Paul had used and put them on those who were sick. The sick people were healed, and evil spirits left them. 13-"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"14 Some Jews also were traveling around forcing evil spirits out of people. The seven sons of Sceva, one of the leading priests, were doing this. These Jews tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus to make the evil spirits go out of people. They all said, “By the same Jesus that Paul talks about, I order you to come out!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"15 But one time an evil spirit said to these Jews, “I know Jesus, and I know about Paul, but who are you?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,16 Then the man who had the evil spirit inside him jumped on these Jews. He was much stronger than all of them. He beat them up and tore their clothes off. They all ran away from that house. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"17 All the people in Ephesus, Jews and Greeks, learned about this. They were all filled with fear and gave great honor to the Lord Jesus. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"18 Many of the believers began to confess, telling about all the evil things they had done. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"19 Some of them had used magic. These believers brought their magic books and burned them before everyone. These books were worth about 50,"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,000 silver coins.* 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"20 This is how the word of the Lord was spreading in a powerful way, causing more and more people to believe. Paul Plans a Trip "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"21 After this, Paul made plans to go to Jerusalem. He planned to go through the regions of Macedonia and Achaia, and then go to Jerusalem. He thought, “After I visit Jerusalem, I must also visit Rome.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,22 Timothy and Erastus were two of his helpers. Paul sent them ahead to Macedonia. But he stayed in Asia for a while. Trouble in Ephesus 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,23 But during that time there was some trouble in Ephesus about the Way. This is how it all happened 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,24 There was a man named Demetrius. He worked with silver. He made little silver models that looked like the temple of the goddess Artemis. The men who did this work made a lot of money. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"25 Demetrius had a meeting with these men and some others who did the same kind of work. He told them, “Men, you know that we make a lot of money from our business. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,26 But look at what this man Paul is doing. Listen to what he is saying. He has convinced many people in Ephesus and all over Asia to change their religion. He says the gods that people make by hand are not real. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,27 I’m afraid this is going to turn people against our business. But there is also another problem. People will begin to think that the temple of the great goddess Artemis is not important. Her greatness will be destroyed. And Artemis is the goddess that everyone in Asia and the whole world worships.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"28 When the men heard this, they became very angry. They shouted, “Great is Artemis, the goddess of Ephesus!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"29 The whole city was thrown into confusion. The people grabbed Gaius and Aristarchus, men from Macedonia who were traveling with Paul, and rushed all together into the stadium. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"30 Paul wanted to go in and talk to the people, but the Lord’s followers did not let him go. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"31 Also, some leaders of the country who were friends of Paul sent him a message telling him not to go into the stadium. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,32 Some people were shouting one thing and others were shouting something else. The meeting was very confused. Most of the people did not know why they had come there. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"33 Some Jews made a man named Alexander stand before * the crowd, and they told him what to say. Alexander waved his hand, trying toexplain things to the people. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"34 But when the people saw that Alexander was a Jew, they all began shouting the same thing. For two hours they continued shouting, “Great is Artemis of Ephesus! Great is Artemis of Ephesus! Great is Artemis …!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"35 Then the city clerk persuaded the people to be quiet. He said, “Men of Ephesus, everyone knows that Ephesus is the city that keeps the temple of the great goddess Artemis. Everyone knows that we also keep her holy rock.† "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"36 No one can deny this, so you should be quiet. You must stop and think before you do anything else. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"37 “You brought these men‡ here, but they have not said anything bad against our goddess. They have not stolen anything from her temple. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,38 We have courts of law and there are judges. Do Demetrius and those men who work with him have a charge against anyone? They should go to the courts. Let them argue with each other there. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,39 “Is there something else you want to talk about? Then come to the regular town meeting of the people. It can be decided there. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"40 I say this because someone might see this trouble today and say we are rioting. We could not explain all this trouble, because there is no real reason for this meeting.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,"41 After the city clerk said this, he told the people to go home. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,16,20 Paul Goes to Macedonia and Greece 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"1 When the trouble stopped, Paul invited the Lord’s followers to come visit him. After encouraging them, he told them goodbye and left for Macedonia. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,2 On his way through Macedonia he had many words of encouragement for the followers in various places. Then he went to Greece 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"3 and stayed there three months. Paul was ready to sail for Syria, but some Jews were planning something against him. So he decided to go back through Macedonia to Syria. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"4 These men were traveling with him Sopater, the son of Pyrrhus, from the city of Berea; Aristarchus and Secundus, from the city of Thessalonica; Gaius, from the city of Derbe; Timothy; and two men from Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"5 These men went first, ahead of Paul. They waited for us in the city of Troas. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,6 We sailed from the city of Philippi after the Festival of Unleavened Bread. We met these men in Troas five days later and stayed there seven days. Paul’s Last Visit to Troas 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"7 On Sunday* we all met together to eat the Lord’s Supper.† Paul talked to the group. Because he was planning to leave the next day, he continued talking until midnight. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"8 We were all together in a room upstairs, and there were many lights in the room. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"9 There was a young man named Eutychus sitting in the window. Paul continued talking, and Eutychus became very, very sleepy. Finally, he went to sleep and fell out of the window. He fell to the ground from the third floor. When the people went down and lifted him up, he was dead. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"10 Paul went down to where Eutychus was, knelt down beside him, and put his arms around him. He said to the other believers, “Don’t worry. He is alive now.” †"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"11 Then Paul went upstairs again, broke off some pieces of bread and ate. He spoke to them a long time. It was early morning when he finished, and then he left. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"12 The Lord’s followers took Eutychus home alive, and they were all greatly comforted. The Trip From Troas to Miletus "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"13 We went on ahead of Paul and sailed for the city of Assos, planning to meet him there. This is what he told us to do because he wanted to go by land. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"14 When he caught up with us at Assos, we took him on board, and we all sailed to Mitylene. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"15 The next day, we sailed away from there and came to a place near the island of Chios. Then the next day, we sailed to the island of Samos. A day later, we came to the city of Miletus. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,16 Paul had already decided not to stop at Ephesus. He did not want to stay too long in Asia. He was hurrying because he wanted to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost if possible. Paul Speaks to the Elders From Ephesus 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"17 In Miletus Paul sent a message back to Ephesus, telling the elders of the church in Ephesus to come to him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"18 When they came, Paul said to them, “You know about my life from the first day I came to Asia. You know the way I lived all the time I was with you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"19 The Jews planned things against me, and this gave me much trouble. But you know that I always served the Lord, sometimes with tears. I never thought about myself first. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,20 I always did what was best for you. I told you the Good News about Jesus in public before the people and also taught in your homes. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,21 I told everyone —Jewish and non-Jewish people—to change and turn to God. I told them all to believe in our Lord Jesus. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,22 “But now I must obey the Spirit and go to Jerusalem. I don’t know what will happen to me there. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,23 I know only that in every city the Holy Spirit tells me that troubles and even jail wait for me. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,24 I don’t care about my own life. The most important thing is that I finish my work. I want to finish the work that the Lord Jesus gave me to do—to tell people the Good News about God’s grace. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"25 “And now listen to me. I know that none of you will ever see me again. All the time I was with you, I told you the Good News about God’s kingdom. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,26 So today I can tell you one thing that I am sure of God will not blame me if some of you are not saved. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,27 I can say this because I know that I told you everything that God wants you to know. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"28 Be careful for yourselves and for all the people God has given you. The Holy Spirit gave you the work of caring for‡ this flock.§ You must be shepherds to the church of God,* the people he bought with his own blood.† "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"29 I know that after I leave, some men will come into your group. They will be like wild wolves and will try to destroy the flock. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"30 Also, men from your own group will begin to teach things that are wrong. They will lead some of the Lord’s followers away from the truth to follow them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"31 So be careful! And always remember what I did during the three years I was with you. I never stopped reminding each one of you how you should live, counseling you day and night and crying over you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,32 “Now I am putting you in God’s care. I am depending on the message about his grace to make you strong. That message is able to give you the blessings that God gives to all his holy people. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"33 When I was with you, I never wanted anyone’s ‡ money or fine clothes. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,34 You know that I always worked to take care of my own needs and the needs of the people who were with me.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,"36 When Paul finished speaking, he knelt down, and they all prayed together. 37-"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,38 They cried and cried. They were especially sad because Paul had said they would never see him again. They hugged him and kissed him. Then they went with him to the ship to say goodbye. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,17,21 Paul Goes to Jerusalem 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"1 After we said goodbye to the elders, we sailed away straight to Cos island. The next day we went to the island of Rhodes, and from there we went to Patara. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,2 There we found a ship that was going to the area of Phoenicia. We got on the ship and sailed away. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"3 We sailed near the island of Cyprus. We could see it on the north side, but we did not stop. We sailed to the country of Syria. We stopped at Tyre because the ship needed to unload its cargo there. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,4 We found the Lord’s followers there and stayed with them for seven days. They warned Paul not to go to Jerusalem because of what the Spirit had told them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"5 But when our time there was up, we returned to the ship to continue our trip. All the followers, even the women and children, came with us to the seashore. We all knelt down on the beach, prayed, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"6 and said goodbye. Then we got on the ship, and the followers went home. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,7 We continued our trip from Tyre and went to the city of Ptolemais. We greeted the believers there and stayed with them one day. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,8 The next day we left Ptolemais and went to the city of Caesarea. We went into the home of Philip and stayed with him. He had the work of telling the Good News. He was one of the seven helpers.* 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,9 He had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophesying. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"10 After we had been there for several days, a prophet named Agabus came from Judea. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"11 He came to us and borrowed Paul’s belt. He used it to tie his own hands and feet. He said, “The Holy Spirit tells me, ‘This is how the Jews in Jerusalem will tie up the man who wears this belt.† Then they will hand him over to people who don’t know God.’ ” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"12 When we heard this, we and the other followers there begged Paul not to go to Jerusalem. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"13 But he said, “Why are you crying and making me feel so sad? I am willing to be put in jail in Jerusalem. I am even ready to die for the name of the Lord Jesus!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"14 We could not persuade him to stay away from Jerusalem. So we stopped begging him and said, “We pray that what the Lord wants will be done.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"15 After this, we got ready and left for Jerusalem. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"16 Some of the followers of Jesus from Caesarea went with us.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,17 The brothers and sisters in Jerusalem were very happy to see us. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"18 The next day Paul went with us to visit James, and all the elders were there. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"19 After * greeting them, Paul told them point by point all that God had used him to doamong the non-Jewish people."
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"20 When the leaders heard this, they praised God. Then they said to Paul, “Brother, you can see that thousands of Jews have become believers, but they think it is very important to obey the Law of Moses. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,21 They have been told that you teach the Jews who live in non-Jewish regions to stop following the Law of Moses. They have heard that you tell them not to circumcise their sons or follow our other customs. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,22 “What should we do? The Jewish believers here will learn that you have come. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,23 So we will tell you what to do Four of our men have made a vow‡ to God. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,24 Take these men with you and share in their cleansing ceremony.§ Pay their expenses so that they can shave their heads.* This will prove to everyone that the things they have heard about you are not true. They will see that you obey the Law of Moses in your own life. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"25 “In regard to the non-Jewish believers, we have already sent a letter to them saying what we think they should do ‘Don’t eat food that has been given to idols. Don’t eat meat from animals that have been strangled or any meat that still has the blood in it. Don’t be involved in sexual sin.’ ” Paul Is Arrested "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,26 So Paul took the four men with him. The next day he shared in their cleansing ceremony. Then he went to the Temple area and announced the time when the days of the cleansing ceremony would be finished. On the last day an offering would be given for each of the men. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"27 When the seven-day period was almost finished, some Jews from Asia saw Paul in the Temple area. They stirred up everyone into an angry mob. They grabbed Paul "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"28 and shouted, “Men of Israel, help us! This is the man who is teaching things that are against the Law of Moses, against our people, and against this Temple of ours. This is what he teaches people everywhere. And now he has brought some Greeks into the Temple area and has made this holy place unclean!” 29 (The Jews said this because they had seen Trophimus with Paul in Jerusalem. Trophimus was a man from Ephesus. The Jews thought that Paul had taken him into the holy area of the Temple.) "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,29 (The Jews said this because they had seen Trophimus with Paul in Jerusalem. Trophimus was a man from Ephesus. The Jews thought that Paul had taken him into the holy area of the Temple.)

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"31 While they were trying to kill Paul, the commander of the Roman army in Jerusalem got word that the whole city was in a state of riot. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"32 Immediately the commander ran to where the crowd had gathered, taking with him some army officers and soldiers. When the people saw the commander and his soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"33 The commander went over to Paul and arrested him. He told his soldiers to tie him up with two chains. Then he asked, “Who is this man? What has he done wrong?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"34 Some people there were shouting one thing, and others were shouting something else. Because of all this confusion and shouting, the commander could not learn the truth about what had happened. So he told the soldiers to take Paul to the army building. 35-"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"36 The whole crowd was following ‡ them. When the soldiers came to the steps, they had to carry Paul. They didthis to protect him, because the people were ready to hurt him. The people wereshouting, “Kill him!”"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"37 When the soldiers were ready to take Paul into the army building, he asked the commander, “Can I say something to you?” The commander said, “Oh, you speak Greek? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,38 Then you are not the man I thought you were. I thought you were the Egyptian who started some trouble against the government not long ago and led four thousand terrorists out to the desert.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,"39 Paul said, “No, I am a Jew from Tarsus in the country of Cilicia. I am a citizen of that important city. Please, let me speak to the people.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,40 The commander told Paul he could speak. So he stood on the steps and waved his hand so that the people would be quiet. The people became quiet and Paul spoke to them in Aramaic. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,18,22 Paul Speaks to the People 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,"1 Paul said, “My brothers and fathers, listen to me! I will make my defense to you.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,"2 When the Jews heard Paul speaking Aramaic, they became very quiet. Then Paul said, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,"3 “I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in the country of Cilicia. I grew up in this city. I was a student of Gamaliel,* who carefully taught me everything about the law of our fathers. I was very serious about serving God, the same as all of you here today. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,4 I persecuted the people who followed the Way. Some of them were killed because of me. I arrested men and women and put them in jail. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,5 “The high priest and the whole council of older Jewish leaders can tell you that this is true. One time these leaders gave me some letters. The letters were to the Jewish brothers in the city of Damascus. I was going there to arrest the followers of Jesus and bring them back to Jerusalem for punishment. Paul Tells About His Conversion 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,6 “But something happened to me on my way to Damascus. It was about noon when I came close to Damascus. Suddenly a bright light from heaven shined all around me. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,"7 I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,"8 “I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ The voice said, ‘I am Jesus from Nazareth, the one you are persecuting.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,"9 The men who were with me did not understand the voice, but they saw the light. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,"10 “I said, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ The Lord answered, ‘Get up and go into Damascus. There you will be told all that I have planned for you to do.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,"11 I could not see, because the bright light had made me blind. So the men led me into Damascus. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,12 “In Damascus a man named Ananias† came to me. He was a man who was devoted to God and obeyed the Law of Moses. All the Jews who lived there respected him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,"13 He came to me and said, ‘Saul, my brother, look up and see again!’ Immediately I was able to see him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,"14 “Ananias told me, ‘The God of our fathers chose you long ago to know his plan. He chose you to see the Righteous One and to hear words from him. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,"17 “Later, I came back to Jerusalem. I was praying in the Temple area, and I saw a vision. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,"18 I saw Jesus, and he said to me, ‘Hurry and leave Jerusalem now! The people here will not accept the truth you tell them about me.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,"19 “I said, ‘But, Lord, the people know that I was the one who put the believers in jail and beat them. I went through all the synagogues to find and arrest the people who believe in you. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,"21 “But Jesus said to me, ‘Leave now. I will send you far away to the non-Jewish people.’ ” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,"22 The people stopped listening when Paul said this last thing. They all shouted, “Get rid of this man! He doesn’t deserve to live.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,"23 They kept on shouting, ripping off their clothes and throwing dust into the air.§ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,24 Then the commander told the soldiers to take Paul into the army building and beat him. He wanted to make Paul tell why the people were shouting against him like this. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,"25 So the soldiers were tying Paul, preparing to beat him. But he said to an army officer there, “Do you have the right to beat a Roman citizen* who has not been proven guilty?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,"26 When the officer heard this, he went to the commander and told him about it. The officer said, “Do you know what you are doing? This man is a Roman citizen!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,"27 The commander came to Paul and said, “Tell me, are you really a Roman citizen?” He answered, “Yes.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,"28 The commander said, “I paid a lot of money to become a Roman citizen.” But Paul said, “I was born a citizen.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,"29 The men who were preparing to question Paul moved away from him immediately. The commander was afraid because he had already put Paul in chains, and he was a Roman citizen. Paul Speaks to the Jewish Leaders "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,19,30 The next day the commander decided to learn why the Jews were accusing Paul. So he ordered the leading priests and the whole high council to meet together. He had Paul’s chains taken off and had him brought in to face the council. 23 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"1 Paul looked at the council members and said, “Brothers, I have lived my life in a good way before God. I have always done what I thought was right.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"2 Ananias,* the high priest, was there. When he heard this, he told the men who were standing near Paul to hit him in the mouth. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"3 Paul said to Ananias, “God will hit you too! You are like a dirty wall that has been painted white. You sit there and judge me, using the Law of Moses. But you are telling them to hit me, and that is against the law.” ‡"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"4 The men standing near Paul said to him, “Are you sure you want to insult God’s high priest like that?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"5 Paul said, “Brothers, I did not know this man was the high priest. The Scriptures say, ‘You must not say bad things about a leader of your people.’✡” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"6 Paul knew that some of the men in the council meeting were Sadducees and some were Pharisees. So he shouted, “My brothers, I am a Pharisee and my father was a Pharisee! I am on trial here because I believe that people will rise from death.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"7 When Paul said this, a big argument started between the Pharisees and the Sadducees. The group was divided. 8 (The Sadducees believe that after people die, they will not live again as an angel or as a spirit. But the Pharisees believe in both.) "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"8 (The Sadducees believe that after people die, they will not live again as an angel or as a spirit. But the Pharisees believe in both.) "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"9 All these Jews began shouting louder and louder. Some of the teachers of the law, who were Pharisees, stood up and argued, “We find nothing wrong with this man. Maybe an angel or a spirit really did speak to him.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"10 The argument turned into a fight, and the commander was afraid that the Jews would tear Paul to pieces. So he told the soldiers to go down and take Paul away from these Jews and put him in the army building. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"11 The next night the Lord Jesus came and stood by Paul. He said, “Be brave! You have told people in Jerusalem about me. You must do the same in Rome.” Some Jews Plan to Kill Paul "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,12 The next morning some of the Jews made a plan to kill Paul. They made a promise to themselves that they would not eat or drink anything until they had killed him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,13 There were more than 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,40 of them who made this plan. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"14 They went and talked to the leading priests and the older Jewish leaders. They said, “We have promised ourselves that we will not eat or drink until we have killed Paul. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,15 So this is what we want you to do Send a message to the commander from you and the high council. Tell him you want him to bring Paul out to you. Say that you want to ask him more questions. We will be waiting to kill him while he is on the way here.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,16 But Paul’s nephew heard about this plan. He went to the army building and told Paul. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"17 Then Paul called one of the army officers and said to him, “Take this young man to the commander. He has a message for him.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"18 So the army officer brought Paul’s nephew to the commander. The officer said, “The prisoner Paul asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to tell you.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"19 The commander led the young man to a place where they could be alone. The commander asked, “What do you want to tell me?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"20 The young man said, “Some Jews have decided to ask you to bring Paul down to their council meeting tomorrow. They want you to think that they plan to ask Paul more questions. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,21 But don’t believe them! More than 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,40 of them are hiding and waiting to kill him. They have all promised not to eat or drink until they have killed him. Now they are waiting for you to say yes.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"22 The commander sent the young man away, telling him, “Don’t tell anyone that you have told me about their plan.” Paul Is Sent to Caesarea "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"23 Then the commander called two army officers. He said to them, “I need some men to go to Caesarea. Get "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"200 soldiers ready. Also, get "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,70 soldiers on horses and  200 men to carry spears. Be ready to leave at nine o’clock tonight. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,24 Get some horses for Paul to ride so that he can be taken to Governor Felix safely.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,25 The commander wrote a letter that said ✡

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"27 Some Jews had taken this man and planned to kill him. But I learned that he is a Roman citizen, so I went with my soldiers and saved him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,28 I wanted to know why they were accusing him. So I brought him before their council meeting. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"29 This is what I learned The Jews said this man did some things that were wrong. But these charges were about their own Jewish laws, and there was nothing worthy of jail or death. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,30 I was told that some of the Jews were making a plan to kill him. So I decided to send him to you. I also told those Jews to tell you what they have against him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,31 The soldiers did what they were told. They got Paul and took him to the city of Antipatris that night. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"32 The next day the soldiers on horses went with Paul to Caesarea, but the other soldiers and the spearmen went back to the army building in Jerusalem. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"33 The soldiers on horses entered Caesarea, gave the letter to Governor Felix, and then turned Paul over to him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"34 The governor read the letter and asked Paul, “What country are you from?” The governor learned that Paul was from Cilicia. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,"35 The governor said, “I will hear your case when the Jews who are accusing you come here too.” Then the governor gave orders for Paul to be kept in the palace built by Herod. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,20,24 Some Jews Accuse Paul 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,21,"1 Five days later Ananias, the high priest, went to the city of Caesarea. He brought with him some of the older Jewish leaders and a lawyer named Tertullus. They went to Caesarea to make charges against Paul before the governor. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,21,"2-3 Paul was called into the meeting, and Tertullus began to make his accusations. Tertullus said, “Most Honorable Felix, our people enjoy much peace because of you, and many wrong things in our country are being made right through your wise help. For this we all continue to be very thankful. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,21,4 But I don’t want to take any more of your time. So I will say only a few words. Please be patient. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,21,5 This man is a troublemaker. He causes trouble with the Jews everywhere in the world. He is a leader of the Nazarene group. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,21,"6-8 Also, he was trying to make the Temple unclean, but we stopped him.* You can decide if all this is true. Ask him some questions yourself.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,21,9 The other Jews agreed and said it was all true. Paul Defends Himself Before Felix 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,21,"10 The governor made a sign for Paul to speak. So Paul answered, “Governor Felix, I know that you have been a judge over this nation for a long time. So I am happy to defend myself before you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,21,11 I went to worship in Jerusalem only twelve days ago. You can learn for yourself that this is true. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,21,12 These Jews who are accusing me did not find me arguing with anyone at the Temple or making trouble with the people. And I was not making trouble or arguing in the synagogues or any other place in the city. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,21,13 These men cannot prove the things they are saying against me now. *
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,21,"14 “But I will tell you this I worship the God of our fathers as a follower of the Way, which these Jews say is not the right way, and I believe everything that is taught in the Law of Moses and all that is written in the books of the prophets. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,21,"15 I have the same hope in God that these Jews have—the hope that all people, good and bad, will be raised from death. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,21,16 This is why I always try to do what I believe is right before God and before everyone. 17-
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,21,"18 “I was away from Jerusalem for many years. I went back there to take money to help my people. I also had some gifts to offer at the Temple. I was doing this when some Jews saw me there. I had finished the cleansing ceremony.† I had not made any trouble, and no one was gathering around me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,21,"19 But some Jews from Asia were there. They should be here, standing before you. If I have really done anything wrong, they are the ones who should accuse me. They were there! "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,21,20 Ask these men here if they found any wrong in me when I stood before the high council meeting in Jerusalem. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,21,"21 I did say one thing when I stood before them and shouted, ‘You are judging me today because I believe that people will rise from death!’ ” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,21,"22 Felix already understood a lot about the Way. He stopped the trial and said, “When commander Lysias comes here, I will decide what to do with you.” "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,21,"25 But Felix became afraid when Paul spoke about things like doing right, self-control, and the judgment that will come in the future. He said, “Go away now. When I have more time, I will call for you.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,21,"26 But Felix had another reason for talking with Paul. He hoped Paul would pay him a bribe, so he sent for Paul often and talked with him. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,2 The leading priests and the important Jewish leaders made charges against Paul before Festus. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,3 They asked Festus to do them a favor. They wanted him to send Paul back to Jerusalem because they had a plan to kill Paul on the way. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,"4 But Festus answered, “No, Paul will be kept in Caesarea. I will be going there soon myself, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,"5 and your leaders can go with me. If this man has really done anything wrong, they can accuse him there.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,6 Festus stayed in Jerusalem another eight or ten days and then went back to Caesarea. The next day Festus told the soldiers to bring Paul before him. Festus was seated on the judgment seat. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,"7 Paul came into the room, and the Jews who had come from Jerusalem stood around him. They made many serious charges against him, but they could not prove anything. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,"8 Paul defended himself, saying, “I have done nothing wrong against the Jewish law, against the Temple, or against Caesar.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,"9 But Festus wanted to please the Jews. So he asked Paul, “Do you want to go to Jerusalem for me to judge you there on these charges?” †"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,"10 Paul said, “I am standing at Caesar’s judgment seat now. This is where I should be judged. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews, and you know it. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,"11 If I have done something wrong and the law says I must die, then I agree that I should die. I don’t ask to be saved from death. But if these charges are not true, then no one can hand me over to these people. No, I want Caesar to hear my case!” "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,"15 When I went to Jerusalem, the leading priests and the older Jewish leaders there made charges against him. They wanted me to order his death. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,"16 But I told them, ‘When a man is accused of doing something wrong, Romans don’t hand him over for others to judge. First, he must face the people accusing him. And then he must be allowed to defend himself against their charges.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,"17 “So when these Jews came here for the trial, I did not waste time. The next day I sat on the judgment seat and ordered Paul to be brought in. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,18 The Jews stood up and accused him. But they did not accuse him of the kind of crimes I thought they would. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,"19 Their charges were all about their own religion and about a man named Jesus. Jesus died, but Paul said that he is still alive. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,"20 I did not have any idea about how to judge these matters. So I asked Paul, ‘Do you want to go to Jerusalem and be judged there?’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,21 But Paul asked to be kept in Caesarea. He wants a decision from the emperor. So I ordered that he be held until I could send him to Caesar in Rome.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,"22 Agrippa said to Festus, “I would like to hear this man too.” Festus said, “Tomorrow you can hear him.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,"23 The next day Agrippa and Bernice came to the meeting with great show, acting like very important people. They entered the room with military leaders and important men of the city. Festus ordered the soldiers to bring Paul in. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,"24 Festus said, “King Agrippa and all of you gathered here with us, you see this man. All the Jewish people, here and in Jerusalem, have complained to me about him. When they complain about him, they shout that he should be killed. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,"25 When I judged him, I did not find him guilty of any crime worthy of death. But he asked to be judged by Caesar, so I decided to send him to Rome. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,"26 However, I don’t really know what to tell Caesar that this man has done wrong. So I have brought him before all of you—especially you, King Agrippa. I hope that you can question him and give me something to write to Caesar. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,27 I think it is foolish to send a prisoner to Caesar without making some charges against him.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,22,26 Paul Before King Agrippa 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"1 Agrippa said to Paul, “You may now speak to defend yourself.” Paul raised his hand to get their attention and began to speak. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"2 He said, “King Agrippa, I feel fortunate that I can stand here before you today and answer all the charges these Jews have made against me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"3 I am very happy to talk to you, because you know so much about all the Jewish customs and the things the Jews argue about. Please listen to me patiently."
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,4 “All the Jews know about my whole life. They know the way I lived from the beginning in my own country and later in Jerusalem. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"5 These Jews have known me for a long time. If they want to, they can tell you that I was a good Pharisee. And the Pharisees obey the laws of the Jewish religion more carefully than any other group. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,6 Now I am on trial because I hope for the promise that God made to our fathers. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"7 This is the promise that all the twelve tribes of our people hope to receive. For this hope the Jews serve God day and night. My king, the Jews have accused me because I hope for this same promise. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,8 Why do you people think it is impossible for God to raise people from death? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,9 “I used to think that I should do everything I could against Jesus from Nazareth. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"10 And that’s what I did, beginning in Jerusalem. The leading priests gave me the authority to put many of God’s people in jail. And when they were being killed, I agreed that it was a good thing. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"11 I visited all the synagogues and punished them, trying to make them curse* Jesus. My anger against these people was so strong that I went to other cities to find them and punish them. Paul Tells About Seeing Jesus "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,12 “One time the leading priests gave me permission and the authority to go to the city of Damascus. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"13 On the way there, at noon, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun. It shined all around me and those traveling with me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"14 We all fell to the ground. Then I heard a voice talking to me in Aramaic. The voice said, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? You are only hurting yourself by fighting me.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"15 “I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ “The Lord said, ‘I am Jesus. I am the one you are persecuting. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,16 Stand up! I have chosen you to be my servant. You will tell people about me—what you have seen today and what I will show you. This is why I have come to you. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"17 I will keep you safe from your own people and from the non-Jewish people, the ones I am sending you to. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"18 You will make them able to understand the truth. They will turn away from darkness to the light. They will turn away from the power of Satan, and they will turn to God. Then their sins can be forgiven, and they can be given a place among God’s people—those who have been made holy by believing in me.’ ” Paul Tells About His Work "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"19 Paul continued speaking “King Agrippa, after I had this vision from heaven, I obeyed it. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,20 I began telling people to change their hearts and lives and turn back to God. And I told them to do what would show that they had really changed. I went first to people in Damascus. Then I went to Jerusalem and to every part of Judea and told the people there. I also went to the non-Jewish people. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,21 “This is why the Jews grabbed me and were trying to kill me at the Temple. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"22 But God helped me, and he is still helping me today. With God’s help I am standing here today and telling all people what I have seen. But I am saying nothing new. I am saying only what Moses and the prophets said would happen. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,23 They said that the Messiah would die and be the first to rise from death. They said that he would bring the light of God’s saving truth† to the Jewish people and to the non-Jewish people.” Paul Tries to Persuade Agrippa *
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"24 While Paul was still defending himself, Festus shouted, “Paul, you are out of your mind! Too much study has made you crazy.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"25 Paul said, “Most Honorable Festus, I am not crazy. What I am saying is true. It all makes perfect sense. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"26 King Agrippa knows about all this, and I can speak freely to him. I know that he has heard about these things, because they happened where everyone could see them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"27 King Agrippa, do you believe what the prophets wrote? I know you believe!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"28 King Agrippa said to Paul, “Do you think you can persuade me to become a ‘Christ-follower’ so easily?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"29 Paul said, “It is not important if it is easy or if it is hard. I pray to God that not only you but that everyone listening to me today could be saved and be just like me—except for these chains I have!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"30 King Agrippa, Governor Festus, Bernice, and all the people sitting with them stood up "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"31 and left the room. They were talking to each other. They said, “This man has done nothing worthy of being put to death or even put in jail.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,"32 And Agrippa said to Festus, “We could let him go free, but he has asked to see Caesar.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,23,27 Paul Sails for Rome 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"1 It was decided that we would sail for Italy. An army officer named Julius, who served in the emperor’s special army, was put in charge of guarding Paul and some other prisoners on the trip. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"2 We got on a ship from the city of Adramyttium that was ready to sail to different places in Asia. Aristarchus, a man from Thessalonica in Macedonia, went with us. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"3 The next day we came to the city of Sidon. Julius was very good to Paul and gave him freedom to go visit his friends there, who gave him whatever he needed. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,4 We left that city and sailed close to the island of Cyprus because the wind was blowing against us. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,5 We went across the sea by Cilicia and Pamphylia. Then we came to the city of Myra in Lycia. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,6 There the army officer found a ship from the city of Alexandria that was going to Italy. So he put us on it. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"7 We sailed slowly for many days. It was hard for us to reach the city of Cnidus because the wind was blowing against us. We could not go any farther that way, so we sailed by the south side of the island of Crete near Salmone. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"8 We sailed along the coast, but the sailing was hard. Then we came to a place called Safe Harbors, near the city of Lasea. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"9 We had lost much time, and it was now dangerous to sail, because it was already after the Jewish day of fasting.* So Paul warned them, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"10 “Men, I can see that there will be a lot of trouble on this trip. The ship, everything in it, and even our lives may be lost!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,11 But the captain and the owner of the ship did not agree with Paul. So the army officer accepted what they said instead of believing Paul. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"12 Also, that harbor was not a good place for the ship to stay for the winter, so most of the men decided that we should leave there. They hoped we could reach Phoenix, where the ship could stay for the winter. Phoenix was a city on the island of Crete. It had a harbor that faced southwest and northwest. The Storm "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"13 Then a good wind began to blow from the south. The men on the ship thought, “This is the wind we wanted, and now we have it!” So they pulled up the anchor. We sailed very close to the island of Crete. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,14 But then a very strong wind called * the “Northeaster” came from across the island. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"15 This wind took the ship and carried it away. The ship could not sail against the wind, so we stopped trying and let the wind blow us. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"16 We went below a small island named Cauda. With the island protecting us from the wind, we were able to bring in the lifeboat, but it was very hard to do. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"17 After the men brought the lifeboat in, they tied ropes around the ship to hold it together. The men were afraid that the ship would hit the sandbanks of Syrtis. So they lowered the sail and let the wind carry the ship. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,18 The next day the storm was blowing against us so hard that the men threw some things out of the ship.† 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,19 A day later they threw out the ship’s equipment. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,20 For many days we could not see the sun or the stars. The storm was very bad. We lost all hope of staying alive—we thought we would die. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"21 The men did not eat for a long time. Then one day Paul stood up before them and said, “Men, I told you not to leave Crete. You should have listened to me. Then you would not have all this trouble and loss. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"22 But now I tell you to be happy. None of you will die, but the ship will be lost. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,23 Last night an angel came to me from God—the God I worship and belong to. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"24 The angel said, ‘Paul, don’t be afraid! You must stand before Caesar. And God has given you this promise He will save the lives of all those sailing with you.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"25 So men, there is nothing to worry about. I trust God, and I am sure everything will happen just as his angel told me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,26 But we will crash on an island.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,27 On the fourteenth night we were still being blown around in the Adriatic Sea. The sailors thought we were close to land. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,28 They threw a rope into the water with a weight on the end of it. They found that the water was 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,120 feet‡ deep. They went a little farther and threw the rope in again. It was 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,90 feet§ deep. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"29 The sailors were afraid that we would hit the rocks, so they threw four anchors into the water. Then they prayed for daylight to come. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"30 Some of the sailors wanted to leave the ship, and they lowered the lifeboat to the water. They wanted the other men to think that they were throwing more anchors from the front of the ship. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"31 But Paul told the army officer and the other soldiers, “If these men do not stay in the ship, you will lose all hope of survival.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,32 So the soldiers cut the ropes and let the lifeboat fall into the water. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"33 Just before dawn Paul began persuading all the people to eat something. He said, “For the past two weeks you have been waiting and watching. You have not eaten for  14 days. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,34 Now I beg you to eat something. You need it to stay alive. None of you will lose even one hair off your heads.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"35 After he said this, Paul took some bread and thanked God for it before all of them. He broke off a piece and began eating. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,36 All the men felt better and started eating too. 37 (There were 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,37 (There were  276 people on the ship.) 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,38 We ate all we wanted. Then we began making the ship lighter by throwing the grain into the sea. The Ship Is Destroyed 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"39 When daylight came, the sailors saw land, but they did not know what land it was. They saw a bay with a beach and wanted to sail the ship to the beach if they could. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,"40 So they cut the ropes to the anchors and left the anchors in the sea. At the same time, they untied the ropes that were holding the rudders. Then they raised the front sail into the wind and sailed toward the beach. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,41 But the ship † hit a sandbank. The front of the ship stuck there and could not move. Then thebig waves began to break the back of the ship to pieces.
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,42 The soldiers decided to kill the prisoners so that none of the prisoners could swim away and escape. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,43 But Julius the army officer wanted to let Paul live. So he did not allow the soldiers to kill the prisoners. He told the people who could swim to jump into the water and swim to land. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,44 The others used wooden boards or pieces of the ship. And this is how all the people went safely to land. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,24,28 Paul on the Island of Malta 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,"1 When we were safe on land, we learned that the island was called Malta. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,"2 The people who lived there were very good to us. It was raining and very cold, so they built a fire and welcomed all of us. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,"3 Paul gathered a pile of sticks for the fire. He was putting the sticks on the fire, and a poisonous snake came out because of the heat and bit him on the hand. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,"4 When the people living on the island saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said, “This man must be a murderer! He did not die in the sea, but Justice* does not want him to live.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,5 But Paul shook the snake off into the fire and was not hurt. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,"6 The people thought he would swell up or fall down dead. They waited and watched him for a long time, but nothing bad happened to him. So they changed their opinion. They said, “He is a god!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,"7 There were some fields around that same area. They were owned by a man named Publius, the most important Roman official on the island. He welcomed us into his home and was very good to us. We stayed in his house for three days. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,"8 Publius’ father was very sick. He had a fever and dysentery, but Paul went to him and prayed for him. He laid his hands on the man and healed him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,"9 After this happened, all the other sick people on the island came to Paul, and he healed them too. 10-"

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,12 We stopped at the city of Syracuse. We stayed there three days and then left. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,"13 We came to the city of Rhegium. The next day a wind began to blow from the southwest, so we were able to leave. A day later we came to the city of Puteoli. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,"14 We found some believers there, who asked us to stay with them a week. Finally, we came to Rome. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,"15 The brothers and sisters in Rome heard about us and came out to meet us at the Market of Appius‡ and at the Three Inns.§ When Paul saw these believers, he thanked God and felt encouraged. Paul in Rome "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,"16 When we came to Rome, Paul was allowed to live alone. But a soldier stayed with him to guard him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,"17 Three days later Paul sent for some of the most important Jews. When they came together, he said, “My brothers, I have done nothing against our people or against the customs of our fathers. But I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed * over to the Romans. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,"18 They asked me many questions, but they could not find any reason why I should be put to death. So they wanted to let me go free. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,19 But the Jews there did not want that. So I had to ask to come to Rome to have my trial before Caesar. That doesn’t mean I am accusing my people of doing anything wrong. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,20 That is why I wanted to see you and talk with you. I am bound with this chain because I believe in the hope of Israel.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,"21 The Jews answered Paul, “We have received no letters from Judea about you. None of our Jewish brothers who have traveled from there brought news about you or told us anything bad about you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,22 We want to hear your ideas. We know that people everywhere are speaking against this new group.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,"23 Paul and the Jews chose a day for a meeting. On that day many more of these Jews met with Paul at his house. He spoke to them all day long, explaining God’s kingdom to them. He used the Law of Moses and the writings of the prophets to persuade them to believe in Jesus. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,"24 Some of the Jews believed what he said, but others did not believe. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,"25 They had an argument among themselves and were ready to leave. But Paul said one more thing to them “The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet. He said, 26 ‘Go to this people and tell them You will listen and you will hear, but you will not understand. You will look and you will see, but you will not understand what you see. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,"26 ‘Go to this people and tell them You will listen and you will hear, but you will not understand. You will look and you will see, but you will not understand what you see. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Acts,25,"27 Yes, the minds of these people are now closed. They have ears, but they don’t listen. They have eyes, but they refuse to see. If their minds were not closed, they might see with their eyes; they might hear with their ears; they might understand with their minds. Then they might turn back to me and be healed.’ Isaiah"

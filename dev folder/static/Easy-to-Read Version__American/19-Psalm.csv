Easy-to-Read Version__American,Psalm,78,32 But the people continued to sin! They did not trust in the amazing things God could do.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Psalm,78,35 They would remember that God was their Rock. They would remember that God Most High had saved them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Psalm,78,36 But they tried to fool him with their words; they told him lies. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Psalm,78,37 Their hearts were not really with him. They were not faithful to the agreement he gave them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Psalm,78,38 But God was merciful. He forgave their sins and did not destroy them. Many times he held back his anger. He never let it get out of control. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Psalm,78,"39 He remembered that they were only people, like a wind that blows and then is gone. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Psalm,78,"40 Oh, they caused him so much trouble in the desert! They made him so sad. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Psalm,78,41 Again and again they tested his patience. They really hurt the Holy One of Israel. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Psalm,78,42 They forgot about his power. They forgot the many times he saved them from the enemy. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Psalm,78,"43 They forgot the miracles in Egypt, the miracles in the fields of Zoan. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Psalm,78,51 He killed all the firstborn sons in Egypt. He killed every firstborn in Ham’s* family. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Psalm,78,52 Then he led Israel like a shepherd. He led his people like sheep into the desert. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Psalm,78,53 He guided them safely. They had nothing to fear. He drowned their enemies in the sea. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Psalm,78,"54 He led his people to his holy land, to the mountain he took with his own power. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Psalm,78,55 He forced the other nations out before them and gave each family its share of the land. He gave each tribe of Israel a place to live. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Psalm,78,56 But they tested God Most High and made him very sad. They didn’t obey his commands. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Psalm,78,57 They turned against him and were unfaithful just like their ancestors. They changed directions like a boomerang. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Psalm,78,58 They built high places and made God angry. They built statues of false gods and made him jealous. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Psalm,78,59 God heard what they were doing and became very angry. So he rejected Israel completely! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Psalm,78,"60 He abandoned his place at Shiloh,† the Holy Tent where he lived among the people. "

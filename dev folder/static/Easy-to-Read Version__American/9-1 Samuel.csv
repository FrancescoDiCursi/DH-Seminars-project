Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,3,12 Eli’s sons were evil men who did not care about the LORD. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,3,"13 They did not care about how priests were supposed to treat people. Whenever someone brings a sacrifice, priests are supposed to put the meat in a pot of boiling water. Then their servant is supposed to get the three-pronged fork "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,3,14 and use it to get some meat out of the pot or kettle. The priest is supposed to take whatever his helper removes from the pot with the special fork. This is what the priests should have ‡ done for the Israelites who came to offer sacrifices at Shiloh. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,3,"15 But that is not what the sons of Eli did. Even before the fat was burned on the altar, their servant would go to the people offering sacrifices and say, “Give the priest some meat to roast. The priest won’t accept boiled meat from you.” "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,3,29 So why don’t you respect these gifts and sacrifices? You honor your sons more than me. You become fat eating the best parts of the meat that the Israelites bring to me.’ 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,3,"30 “The LORD, the God of Israel, promised that your father’s family would serve him forever. But now the LORD says, ‘That will never be! I will honor people who honor me, but bad things will happen to those who refuse to respect me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,3,31 The time is coming when I will destroy all your descendants. No one in your family will live to be an old man. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,3,"32 Good things will happen to Israel, but you will see bad things happening at home.§ No one in your family will live to be an old man. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,3,33 There is only one man I will save to serve as priest at my altar. He will live until his eyes wear out and his strength is gone. But all of your descendants will die † by the sword.*

Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,3,"35 I will choose a priest I can trust. This priest will listen to me and do what I want. I will make his family strong, and he will always serve before my chosen king.† "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,3,"36 Then whoever is left in your family will come and bow down before this priest and beg for a little money or a piece of bread. They will say, “Please give me a job as priest so that I can have some food to eat.” ’ ” "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,4,"12 I will do everything I said I would do against Eli and his family, everything from the beginning to the end. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,4,13 I told Eli I would punish his family forever. I will do this because Eli knew his sons were saying and doing bad things against God. But he failed to control them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,4,14 That is why I swore an oath that sacrifices and offerings will never take away the sins of the people in Eli’s family.‡” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,4,15 Samuel lay down in bed until the morning came. He got up early and opened the doors of the LORD’S house. Samuel was afraid to tell Eli about the vision. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,4,"16 But Eli said to Samuel, “Samuel, my son.” Samuel answered, “Yes, sir.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,4,"17 Eli asked, “What did God say to you? Don’t hide it from me. God will punish you if you hide anything from the message he spoke to you.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,4,"18 So Samuel told Eli everything. He did not hide anything from him. * Eli said, “He is the LORD. Let him do whatever he thinks is right.”"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,4,19 The LORD was with Samuel while he grew up. He did not let any of Samuel’s messages prove false. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,4,"20 Then all Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, knew that Samuel was a true prophet of the LORD. "

Let’s bring the LORD’S Box of the Agreement from Shiloh. God will go with us into battle and save us from our enemies.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,5,"4 So the people sent men to Shiloh. The men brought back the LORD All- Powerful’s Box of the Agreement. On top of the Box are the Cherub angels. They are like a throne where the Lord sits. Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, came with the Box. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,5,"7 They became afraid and said, “Gods have come to their camp! We’re in trouble. This has never happened before. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,"3 Jonathan defeated the Philistines at their camp in Geba. The Philistines heard about this. They said, “The Hebrews have rebelled.”‡ Saul said, “Let the Hebrew people hear what happened.” So Saul told the men to blow trumpets through all the land of Israel. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,4 All the Israelites heard this news “Saul has killed the Philistine leader. Now the Philistines will really hate the Israelites!” The Israelites were called to join Saul at Gilgal. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,"5 The Philistines gathered to fight Israel. The Philistines camped at Micmash, east of Beth Aven. They had "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,3000§ chariots and 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,6000 horse soldiers. There were so many Philistines that they were like sand on the seashore. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,"6 The Israelites saw that they were in trouble. They felt trapped. They ran away to hide in caves and cracks in the rock. They hid among the rocks, in wells, and in other holes in the ground. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,7 Some Hebrews even went across the Jordan River to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul was still at Gilgal. All the men in his army were shaking with fear. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,"8 Samuel said he would meet Saul at Gilgal. Saul waited there seven days. But Samuel had not yet come to Gilgal, and the soldiers began to leave Saul. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,"9 So Saul said, “Bring me the burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings.” Then Saul offered the burnt offering. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,"10 As soon as Saul finished offering that sacrifice, Samuel arrived. Saul went out to meet him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,"11 Samuel asked, “What have you done?” Saul answered, “I saw the soldiers leaving me. You were not here on time, and the Philistines were gathering at Micmash. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,"12 I thought to myself, ‘The Philistines will come here and attack me at Gilgal, and I haven’t asked the LORD to help us yet. So I forced myself to offer the burnt offering.’ ” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,"13 Samuel said, “You did a foolish thing. You did not obey the LORD your God. If you had done what he commanded, the LORD would have let your family rule Israel forever. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,"14 But now your kingdom won’t continue. The LORD was looking for a man who wants to obey him.* He has found that man —and the LORD has chosen him to be the new leader of his people, because you didn’t obey his command.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,15 Then Samuel got up and left Gilgal. The Battle at Micmash * Saul and the rest of his army left Gilgal† and went to Gibeah in Benjamin. Saulcounted the men who were still with him. There were about 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,"16 Saul, his son Jonathan, and the soldiers went to Geba in Benjamin. The Philistines were camped at Micmash. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,"17 So their best soldiers began the attack. The Philistine army split into three groups. One group went north on the road to Ophrah, near Shual. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,"18 The second group went southeast on the road to Beth Horon, and the third group went east on the road to the border. That road looks over the Valley of Zeboim toward the desert. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,19 There were no blacksmiths in Israel. The Philistines would not allow them because they were afraid the Israelites would make iron swords and spears. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,"20 Only the Philistines could sharpen iron tools. So if the Israelites needed to sharpen their plows, hoes, axes, or sickles, they had to go to the Philistines. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,21 The Philistine blacksmiths charged 1/

Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,"6 ounce§ of silver for sharpening picks, axes, and the iron tip on ox goads. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,"22 So on the day of battle, none of the Israelite soldiers with Saul had iron swords or spears. Only Saul and his son Jonathan had such weapons. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,23 A group of Philistine soldiers guarded the mountain pass at Micmash. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,14,14 Jonathan Attacks the Philistines 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"1 That day, Saul’s son Jonathan was talking with the young man who carried his weapons. Jonathan said, “Let’s go to the Philistine camp on the other side of the valley.” But Jonathan did not tell his father. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,2 Saul was sitting under a pomegranate tree at the threshing floor* at the edge of the hill.† Saul had about  600 men with him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,3 One of the men was named Ahijah. Ahijah was a son of Ichabod’s brother Ahitub. Ahitub was the son of Phinehas. Phinehas was the son of Eli. Eli had been the LORD’S priest at Shiloh. Now Ahijah was the priest who wore the ephod. These men did not know that Jonathan had left. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,4 Jonathan was planning to go through a pass to get to the Philistine camp. There was a large rock on each side of the pass. The large rock on one side was named Bozez. The large rock on the other side was named Seneh. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"5 One of the rocks faced north toward Micmash, and the other faced south toward Geba. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"6 Jonathan said to his young helper who carried his weapons, “Come on, let’s go to the camp of those foreigners.‡ Maybe the LORD will use us to defeat them. Nothing can stop the LORD—it doesn’t matter if we have many soldiers or just a few soldiers.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"7 The young man who carried Jonathan’s weapons said to him, “Do what you think is best. Whatever you decide, I am with you all the way.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"8 Jonathan said, “Let’s go! We’ll cross the valley and go to the Philistine guards. We’ll let them see us. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"9 If they say to us, ‘Stay there until we come to you,’ we will stay where we are. We won’t go up to them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"10 But if the Philistine men say, ‘Come up here,’ then we will climb up to them. That will be a sign from God. That will mean that the LORD will allow us to defeat them.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"11 So Jonathan and his helper let the Philistines see them. The Philistine guards said, “Look! The Hebrews are coming out of the holes they were hiding in.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"12 The † Philistines in the fort shouted to Jonathan and his helper, “Come up here. We’llteach you a lesson.”Jonathan said to his helper, “Follow me up the hill. The LORD is letting Israeldefeat the Philistines.”"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"14 So Jonathan climbed up the hill with his hands and feet, and his helper was right behind him. Jonathan and his helper attacked them. In the first attack, they killed "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,20 Philistines in an area about one-half acre in size. Jonathan fought the men who attacked from the front. His helper came behind him and killed the men who were only wounded. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"15 Great fear spread among the Philistine soldiers—those in the field, in the camp, and at the fort. Even the bravest soldiers were afraid. The ground began to shake, and they were completely overcome with fear. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,16 Saul’s guards at Gibeah in the land of Benjamin saw the Philistine soldiers running away in different ways. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"17 Saul said to the army with him, “Count the men. I want to know who left camp.” They counted the men. Jonathan and his helper were gone. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"18 Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring God’s Holy Box!” (At that time God’s Holy Box was there with the Israelites.)§ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"19 Saul was talking to Ahijah the priest waiting for advice from God. But the noise and confusion in the Philistine camp was growing and growing. Saul was becoming impatient. Finally, he said to Ahijah the priest, “That’s enough. Put your hand down and stop praying.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,20 Saul gathered his army together and went to the battle. The Philistine soldiers were very confused. They were even fighting each other with their swords. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,21 There were Hebrews who served the Philistines in the past and who stayed in the Philistine camp. But now these Hebrews joined the Israelites with Saul and Jonathan. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,22 All the Israelites who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard the Philistine soldiers were running away. So these Israelites also joined in the battle and began chasing the Philistines. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"23 So the LORD saved the Israelites that day. The battle moved on past Beth Aven. The whole army was with Saul—he now had about 10, 000 men. The battle spread to every city in the hill country of Ephraim.* Saul Makes Another Mistake "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"24 But Saul made a big mistake that day.† He made this oath “If any man eats food before evening comes, before I finish defeating my enemies, he will be under a curse.” He made the soldiers promise not to eat. So none of them ate anything. 25-"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"26 Because of the fighting, the people went into some woods. Then they saw a honeycomb on the ground. The Israelites went up to the honeycomb, but they didn’t eat any of it. They were afraid to break the promise. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"27 But Jonathan didn’t know about the oath. He didn’t hear his father make the soldiers promise not to eat. Jonathan had a stick in his hand, so he dipped the end of the stick into the honeycomb and pulled out some honey. He ate the honey and began to feel much better. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"28 One of the soldiers told Jonathan, “Your father forced the soldiers to make a special promise. He said that any man who eats today will be under a curse. So the men have not eaten anything. That’s why they are weak.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"29 Jonathan said, “My father has brought a lot of trouble to the land. See how much better I feel after tasting just a little of this honey. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,30 It would have been § much better for the men to eat the food that they took from their enemies today.We could have killed more Philistines.”
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,31 That day the Israelites defeated the Philistines. They fought them all the way from Micmash to Aijalon. So the people were very tired and hungry. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"32 They had taken sheep, cattle, and calves from the Philistines. Now they were so hungry that they killed the animals on the ground and ate them. And the blood was still in the animals. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"33 Someone said to Saul, “Look, the men are sinning against the LORD. They’re eating meat that still has blood in it!” Saul said, “You have sinned. Roll a large stone over here now!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"34 Then Saul said, “Go to the men and tell them that each one must bring his bull and sheep to me. Then the men must kill their bulls and sheep here. Don’t sin against the LORD! Don’t eat meat that still has blood in it.” That night everyone brought their animals and killed them there. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,35 Then Saul built an altar for the LORD. Saul himself began building that altar for the LORD. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"36 Saul said, “Let’s go after the Philistines tonight. We will take everything from them. We will kill them all!” The army answered, “Do whatever you think is best.” But the priest said, “Let’s ask God.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"37 So Saul asked God, “Should I go chase the Philistines? Will you let us defeat the Philistines?” But God did not answer Saul that day. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"38 So Saul said, “Bring all the leaders to me! Let’s find who committed the sin today. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"39 I swear by the LORD who saves Israel, that even if my own son Jonathan sinned, he must die.” None of the people said a word. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"40 Then Saul said to all the Israelites, “You stand on this side. I and my son Jonathan will stand on the other side.” The soldiers answered, “As you wish, sir.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"41 Then Saul prayed, “LORD, God of Israel, why haven’t you answered me today? Show us who sinned. If it was I or my son Jonathan, give Urim. But if it was your people Israel who sinned, give Thummim.”‡ Saul and Jonathan were shown to be the ones who sinned, and the people went free. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"42 Saul said, “Throw them again to show the guilty one—me or my son Jonathan.” Jonathan was shown to be the one. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"43 Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” Jonathan told Saul, “I only tasted a little honey from the end of my stick. Should I die for doing that?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"44 Saul said, “I made an oath and asked God to punish me if I didn’t keep it. Jonathan, you must die.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"45 But the soldiers said to Saul, “Jonathan led Israel to a great victory today. Must Jonathan die? Never! As surely as the LORD lives, not one hair of Jonathan’s head will fall to the ground! God helped Jonathan fight against the Philistines today.” So the people saved Jonathan from death. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,46 Saul did not chase the Philistines. The Philistines went back to their place. Saul Fights Israel’s Enemies 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"47 Saul took full control of Israel and fought all the enemies who lived around Israel. Saul fought Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the king of Zobah, and the Philistines. He defeated Israel’s enemies wherever he went. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Samuel,15,"52 Saul was brave all his life. He fought hard against the Philistines. Any time Saul saw a man who was strong or brave, he took that man and put him into the group of soldiers who stayed near the king and protected him. "

Samuel Tells Saul About His Sin "

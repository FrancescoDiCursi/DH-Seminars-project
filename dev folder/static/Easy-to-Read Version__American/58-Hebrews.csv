Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews, HebrewsGod Has Spoken Through His Son,
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,1,1 In the past God spoke to our people through the prophets. He spoke to them many times and in many different ways. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,1,"2 And now in these last days, God has spoken to us again through his Son. He made the whole world through his Son. And he has chosen his Son to have all things. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,1,"3 The Son shows the glory of God. He is a perfect copy of God’s nature, and he holds everything together by his powerful command. The Son made people clean from their sins. Then he sat down at the right side* of God, the Great One in heaven. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,1,"4 The Son became much greater than the angels, and God gave him a name that is much greater than any of their names. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,1,5 God never said this to any of the angels “You are my Son. Today I have become your Father.” Psalm
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,1,"12 You will fold them up like a coat, and they will be changed like clothes. But you never change, and your life will never end.” Psalm needed to do. He made perfect the one who leads those people to salvation. Hemade Jesus a perfect Savior through his suffering."
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,1,"11 Jesus, the one who makes people holy, and those who are made holy are from the same family. So he is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,1,"12 He says, “God, I will tell my brothers and sisters about you. Before all your people I will sing your praises.” Psalm"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,1,"10 So I was angry with them. I said, ‘Their thoughts are always wrong. They have never understood my ways.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,1,11 So I was angry and made a promise ‘They will never enter my place of rest.’ ” Psalm
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,1,9 This shows that the seventh-day rest* for God’s people is still to come. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,1,10 God rested after he finished his work. So everyone who enters God’s place of rest will also have rest from their own work just as God did. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,1,11 So let us try as hard as we can to enter God’s place of rest. We must try hard so that none of us will be lost by following the example of those who refused to obey God. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,1,12 God’s word† is alive and working. It is sharper than the sharpest sword and cuts all the way into us. It cuts deep to the place where the soul and the spirit are joined. God’s word cuts to the center of our joints and our bones. It judges the thoughts and feelings in our hearts. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,1,13 Nothing in all the world can be hidden from God. He can clearly see all things. Everything is open before him. And to him we must explain the way we have lived. Jesus Christ Is Our High Priest 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,1,14 We have a great high priest who has gone to live with God in heaven. He is Jesus the Son of God. So let us continue to express our faith in him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,1,"15 Jesus, our high priest, is able to understand our weaknesses. When Jesus lived on earth, he was tempted in every way. He was tempted in the same ways we are tempted, but he never sinned. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,1,"16 With Jesus as our high priest, we can feel free to come before God’s throne where there is grace. There we receive mercy and kindness to help us when we need it. 5 "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,2,1 Every Jewish high priest is chosen from among men. That priest is given the work of helping people with the things they must do for God. He must offer to God gifts and sacrifices for sins. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,2,2 The high priest has his own weaknesses. So he is able to be gentle with those who do wrong out of ignorance. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,2,"3 He offers sacrifices for their sins, but he must also offer sacrifices for his own sins. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,2,4 To be a high priest is an honor. But no one chooses himself for this work. That person must be chosen by God just as Aaron was. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,2,"5 It is the same with Christ. He did not choose himself to have the honor of becoming a high priest. But God chose him. God said to him, “You are my Son. Today I have become your Father.” Psalm"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,2,11 We have many things to tell you about this. But it is hard to explain because you have stopped trying to understand. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,2,12 You have had enough time that by now you should be teachers. But you need someone to teach you again the first lessons of God’s teaching. You still need the teaching that is like milk. You are not ready for solid food. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,2,13 Anyone who lives on milk is still a baby and is not able to understand much about living right. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,2,14 But solid food is for people who have grown up. From their experience they have learned to see the difference between good and evil. 6 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,3,"1-2 So we should be finished with the beginning lessons about Christ. We should not have to keep going back to where we started. We began our new life by turning away from the evil we did in the past and by believing in God. That’s when we were taught about baptisms,* laying hands on people, the resurrection of those who have died, and the final judgment. Now we need to go forward to more mature teaching. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,3,3 And that’s what we will do if God allows. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,3,"4-6 After people have left the way of Christ, can you make them change their lives again? I am talking about people who once learned the truth, received God’s gift, and shared in the Holy Spirit. They were blessed to hear God’s good message and see the great power of his new world. But then they left it all behind, and it is not possible to make them change again. That’s because those who leave Christ are nailing him to the cross again, shaming him before everyone. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,3,7 Some people are like land that gets plenty of rain and produces a good crop for those who farm it. That kind of land has God’s blessing. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,3,8 But other people are like land that grows only thorns and weeds. It is worthless and in danger of being cursed by God. It will be destroyed by fire. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,3,"9 Dear friends, I am not saying this because I think it is happening to you. We really expect that you will do better—that you will do the good things that will result in your salvation. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,3,"10 God is fair, and he will remember all the work you have done. He will remember that you showed your love to him by helping his people and that you continue to help them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,3,11 We want each of you to be willing and eager to show your love like that the rest of your life. Then you will be sure to get what you hope for. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,3,"12 We don’t want you to be lazy. We want you to be like those who, because of their faith and patience, will get what God has promised. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,3,"13 God made a promise to Abraham. And there is no one greater than God, so he made the promise with an oath in his own name—an oath that he would do what he promised. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,3,"14 He said, “I will surely bless you. I will give you many descendants.”✡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,3,"15 Abraham waited patiently for this to happen, and later he received what God promised. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,3,"16 People always use the name of someone greater than themselves to make a promise with an oath. The oath proves that what they say is true, and there is no more arguing about it. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,3,"17 God wanted to prove that his promise was true. He wanted to prove this to those who would get what he promised. He wanted them to understand clearly that his purposes never change. So God said something would happen, and he proved what he said by adding an oath. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,3,"18 These two things cannot change God cannot lie when he says something, and he cannot lie when he makes an oath. * So these two things are a great help to us who have come to God for safety. Theyencourage us to hold on to the hope that is ours. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,3,19 This hope is like an anchor for us. It is strong and sure and keeps us safe. It goes behind the curtain.† 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,3,"20 Jesus has already entered there and opened the way for us. He has become the high priest forever, just like Melchizedek. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,3,7 The Priest Melchizedek 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,1 Melchizedek was the king of Salem and a priest for God the Most High. He met Abraham when Abraham was coming back after defeating the kings. That day Melchizedek blessed him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"2 Then Abraham gave him a tenth of everything he had. The name Melchizedek, king of Salem, has two meanings. First, Melchizedek means “king of justice.” And “king of Salem” means “king of peace.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,3 No one knows who his father or mother was or where he came from.* And no one knows when he was born or when he died. Melchizedek is like the Son of God in that he will always be a priest. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"4 You can see that Melchizedek was very great. Abraham, our great ancestor, gave him a tenth of everything he won in battle. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"5 Now the law says that those from the tribe of Levi who become priests must get a tenth from their own people, even though they and their people are both from the family of Abraham. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"6 Melchizedek was not even from the tribe of Levi, but Abraham gave him a tenth of what he had. And Melchizedek blessed Abraham—the one who had God’s promises. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,7 And everyone knows that the more important person always blesses the less important person. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"8 Those priests get a tenth, but they are only men who live and then die. But Melchizedek, who got a tenth from Abraham, continues to live, as the Scriptures say. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"9 Now those from the family of Levi are the ones who get a tenth from the people. But we can say that when Abraham paid Melchizedek a tenth, then Levi also paid it. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"10 Levi was not yet born, but he already existed in his ancestor Abraham when Melchizedek met him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"11 The people were given the law under the system of priests from the tribe of Levi. But no one could be made spiritually perfect through that system of priests. So there was a need for another priest to come. I mean a priest like Melchizedek, not Aaron. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"12 And when a different kind of priest comes, then the law must be changed too. 13-"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"14 We are talking about our Lord Christ, who belonged to a different tribe. No one from that tribe ever served as a priest at the altar. It is clear that Christ came from the tribe of Judah. And Moses said nothing about priests belonging to that tribe. Jesus Is a Priest Like Melchizedek "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,15 And these things become even clearer when we see that another priest has come who is like Melchizedek. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"16 He was made a priest, but not because he met the requirement of being born into the right family. He became a priest by the power of a life that will never end. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,17 This is what the Scriptures say about him “You are a priest forever—the kind of priest Melchizedek was.”✡ †
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,18 The old rule is now ended because it was weak and worthless. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,19 The Law of Moses could not make anything perfect. But now a better hope has been given to us. And with that hope we can come near to God. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"20 Also, it is important that God made a promise with an oath when he made Jesus high priest. When those other men became priests, there was no oath. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"21 But Christ became a priest with God’s oath. God said to him, “The Lord has made a promise with an oath and will not change his mind ‘You are a priest forever.’ ” Psalm “The time is coming, says the Lord,when I will give a new agreementto the people of Israel and to the people of Judah."
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"9 It will not be like the agreement that I gave to their fathers. That is the agreement I gave when I took them by the hand and led them out of Egypt. They did not continue following the agreement I gave them, and I turned away from them, says the Lord. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"10 This is the new agreement I will give the people of Israel. I will give this agreement in the future, says the Lord I will put my laws in their minds, and I will write my laws on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,11 Never again will anyone have to teach their neighbors or their family to know the Lord. All people—the greatest and the least important—will know me. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"12 And I will forgive the wrongs they have done, and I will not remember their sins.” Jeremiah"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,10 These gifts and sacrifices are only about food and drink and special washings. They are only rules about the body. God gave them for his people to follow until the time of his new way. Worship Under the New Agreement 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"11 But Christ has already come to be the high priest. He is the high priest of the good things we now have. But Christ does not serve in a place like the tent that those other priests served in. He serves in a better place. Unlike that tent, this one is perfect. It was not made by anyone here on earth. It does not belong to this world. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"12 Christ entered the Most Holy Place only one time—enough for all time. He entered the Most Holy Place by using his own blood, not the blood of goats or young bulls. He entered there and made us free from sin forever. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,13 The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a cow were sprinkled on those who were no longer pure enough to enter the place of worship. The blood and ashes made them pure again—but only their bodies. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,14 So surely the blood sacrifice of Christ can do much more. Christ offered himself through the eternal Spirit‡ as a perfect sacrifice to God. His blood will make us completely clean from the evil we have done. It will give us clear consciences so that we can worship the living God. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"15 So Christ brings a new agreement from God to his people. He brings this agreement so that those who are chosen by God can have the blessings God promised, blessings that last forever. This can happen only because Christ died to free people from sins committed against the commands of the first agreement. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"16 When someone dies and leaves a will, there must be proof that the one who wrote the will is dead. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,17 A will means nothing while the one who wrote it is still living. It can be used only after that person’s death. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,18 That is why blood was needed to begin the first agreement between God and his people. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"19 First, Moses told the people every command in the law. Then he took the blood of young bulls and mixed it with water. He used red wool and a branch of hyssop to sprinkle the blood and water on the book of the law and on all the people. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"20 Then he said, “This is the blood that makes the agreement good—the agreement that God commanded you to follow.”✡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"21 In the same way, Moses sprinkled the blood on the Holy Tent. He sprinkled the blood over everything used in worship. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,22 The law says that almost everything must be made clean by blood. Sins cannot be forgiven without a blood sacrifice. Jesus Christ Is Our Sacrifice for Sin 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,23 These things are copies of the real things that are in heaven. These copies had to be made clean by animal sacrifices. But the real things in heaven must have much better sacrifices. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"24 Christ went into the Most Holy Place. But it was not the man-made one, which is only a copy of the real one. He went into heaven, and he is there now before God to help us. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"25 The high priest enters the Most Holy Place once every year. He takes with him blood to offer. But he does not offer his own blood like Christ did. Christ went into heaven, but not to offer himself many times like the high priest offers blood again and again. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"26 If Christ had offered himself many times, he would have needed to suffer many times since the time the world was made. But he came to offer himself only once. And that once is enough for all time. He came at a time when the world is nearing an end. He came to take away all sin by offering himself as a sacrifice. ‡"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,27 Everyone must die once. Then they are judged. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,"28 So Christ was offered as a sacrifice one time to take away the sins of many people. And he will come a second time, but not to offer himself for sin. He will come the second time to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,4,10 Jesus Christ—the Only Sacrifice We Need 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,1 The law gave us only an unclear picture of the good things coming in the future. The law is not a perfect picture of the real things. The law tells people to offer the same sacrifices every year. Those who come to worship God continue to offer those sacrifices. But the law can never make them perfect. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,"2 If the law could make people perfect, those sacrifices would have already stopped. They would already be clean from their sins, and they would not still feel guilty. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,"3 But that’s not what happens. Their sacrifices make them remember their sins every year, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,4 because it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,"5 So when Christ came into the world he said, “You don’t want sacrifices and offerings, but you have prepared a body for me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,6 You are not pleased with the sacrifices of animals killed and burned or with offerings to take away sins. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,"7 Then I said, ‘Here I am, God. It is written about me in the book of the law. I have come to do what you want.’ ” Psalm and never again remember the evil they have done.” Jeremiah"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,38 The person who is right with me will live by trusting in me. But I will not be pleased with the one who turns back in fear.” Habakkuk
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,"18 God tested Abraham’s faith. God told him to offer Isaac as a sacrifice. Abraham obeyed because he had faith. He already had the promises from God. And God had already said to him, “It is through Isaac that your descendants will come.”✡ But Abraham was ready to offer his only son. He did this because he had faith. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,"19 He believed that God could raise people from death. And really, when God stopped Abraham from killing Isaac, it was as if he got him back from death. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,20 Isaac blessed the future of Jacob and Esau. He did that because he had faith. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,"21 And Jacob, also because he had faith, blessed each one of Joseph’s sons. He did this while he was dying, leaning on his rod and worshiping God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,"22 And when Joseph was almost dead, he spoke about the people of Israel leaving Egypt. And he told them what they should do with his body. He did this because he had faith. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,23 And the mother and father of Moses hid him for three months after he was born. They did this because they had faith. They saw that Moses was a beautiful baby. And they were not afraid to disobey the king’s order. 24-
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,"25 Moses grew up and became a man. He refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter. He chose not to enjoy the pleasures of sin that last such a short time. Instead, he chose to suffer with God’s people. He did this because he had faith. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,26 He thought it was better to suffer for the Messiah than to have all the treasures of Egypt. He was waiting for the reward that God would give him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,27 Moses left Egypt because he had faith. He was not afraid of the king’s anger. He continued strong as if he could see the God no one can see. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,"28 Moses prepared the Passover and spread the blood on the doorways of the people of Israel, so that the angel of death† would not kill their firstborn sons. Moses did this because he had faith. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,"29 And God’s people all walked through the Red Sea as if it were dry land. They were able to do this because they had faith. But when the Egyptians tried to follow them, they were drowned. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,"30 And the walls of Jericho fell because of the faith of God’s people. They marched around the walls for seven days, and then the walls fell. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,"31 And Rahab, the prostitute, welcomed the Israelite spies like friends. And because of her faith, she was not killed with the ones who refused to obey. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,"32 Do I need to give you more examples? I don’t have enough time to tell you about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,"33 All of them had great faith. And with that faith they defeated kingdoms. They did what was right, and God helped them in the ways he promised. With their faith some people closed the mouths of lions. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,34 And some were able to stop blazing fires. Others escaped from being killed with swords. Some who were weak were made strong. They became powerful in battle and defeated other armies. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,35 There were women who lost loved ones but got them back when they were raised from death. Others were tortured but refused to accept their freedom. They did this so that they could be raised from death to a better life. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,36 Some were laughed at and beaten. Others were tied up and put in prison. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,"37 They were killed with stones. They were cut in half. They were killed with swords. The only clothes some of them had were sheepskins or goatskins. They were poor, persecuted, and treated badly by others. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,"38 The world was not good enough for these great people. They had to wander in deserts and mountains, living in caves and holes in the ground. ✡"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,39 God was pleased with all of them because of their faith. But not one of them received God’s great promise. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,"40 God planned something better for us. He wanted to make us perfect. Of course, he wanted those great people to be made perfect too, but not before we could all enjoy that blessing together. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,5,12 We Also Should Follow Jesus’ Example 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,6,"1 We have all these great people around us as examples. Their lives tell us what faith means. So we, too, should run the race that is before us and never quit. We should remove from our lives anything that would slow us down and the sin that so often makes us fall. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,6,"2 We must never stop looking to Jesus. He is the leader of our faith, and he is the one who makes our faith complete. He suffered death on a cross. But he accepted the shame of the cross as if it were nothing because of the joy he could see waiting for him. And now he is sitting at the right side of God’s throne. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,6,3 Think about Jesus. He patiently endured the angry insults that sinful people were shouting at him. Think about him so that you won’t get discouraged and stop trying. God Is Like a Father 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,6,"4 You are struggling against sin, but you have not had to give up your life for the cause. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,6,"5 You are children of God, and he speaks words of comfort to you. You have forgotten these words “My child, don’t think the Lord’s discipline is worth nothing, and don’t stop trying when he corrects you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,6,"6 The Lord disciplines everyone he loves; he punishes everyone he accepts as a child.” Proverbs blessing so much that he cried. But his father refused to give him the blessing,because Esau could find no way to change what he had done."
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,6,"18 You have not come to a place that can be seen and touched, like the mountain the people of Israel saw, which was burning with fire and covered with darkness, gloom, and storms. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,6,"19 There is no sound of a trumpet or a voice speaking words like those they heard. When they heard the voice, they begged never to hear another word. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,6,"20 They did not want to hear the command “If anything, even an animal, touches the mountain, it must be killed with stones.”✡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,6,"21 What they saw was so terrible that Moses said, “I am shaking with fear.”✡* "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,6,"22 But you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem.† You have come to a place where thousands of angels have gathered to celebrate. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,6,"23 You have come to the meeting of God’s firstborn‡ children. Their names are written in heaven. You have come to God, the judge of all people. And you have come to the spirits of good people who have been made perfect. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,6,24 You have come to Jesus—the one who brought the new agreement from God to his people. You have come to the sprinkled blood§ that tells us about better things than the blood of Abel. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,6,25 Be careful and don’t refuse to listen when God speaks. Those people refused to listen to him when he warned them on earth. And they did not escape. Now God is speaking from heaven. So now it will be worse for those who refuse to listen to him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,6,"26 When he spoke before, his voice shook the earth. But now he has promised, “Once again I will shake the earth, but I will also shake heaven.”✡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,6,"27 The words “once again” clearly show us that everything that was created will be destroyed—that is, the things that can be shaken. And only what cannot be shaken will remain. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,6,"28 So we should be thankful because we have a kingdom that cannot be shaken. And because we are thankful, we should worship God in a way that will please him. We should do this with respect and fear, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,6,29 because our God is like a fire that can destroy us. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,6,13 Worship That Pleases God 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,7,1 Continue loving each other as brothers and sisters in Christ. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,7,2 Always remember to help people by welcoming them into your home. Some people have done that and have helped angels without knowing it. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,7,3 Don’t forget those who are in prison. Remember them as though you were in prison with them. And don’t forget those who are suffering. Remember them as though you were suffering with them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,7,4 Marriage should be honored by everyone. And every marriage should be kept pure between husband and wife. God will judge guilty those who commit sexual sins and adultery. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,7,"5 Keep your lives free from the love of money. And be satisfied with what you have. God has said, “I will never leave you; I will never run away from you.” Deuteronomy"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Hebrews,7,"6 So we can feel sure and say, “The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. People can do nothing to me.” Psalm"

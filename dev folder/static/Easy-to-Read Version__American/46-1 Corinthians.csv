Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,1,1 Corinthians 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,"1 Greetings from Paul. I was chosen to be an apostle of Christ Jesus. God chose me because that is what he wanted. Greetings also from Sosthenes, our brother in Christ. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,"2 To God’s church in Corinth, you who have been made holy because you belong to Christ Jesus. You were chosen to be God’s holy people together with all people everywhere who trust in the Lord* Jesus Christ—their Lord and ours. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,3 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Paul Gives Thanks to God 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,4 I always thank my God for you because of the grace that he has given you through Christ Jesus. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,5 In him you have been blessed in every way. You have been blessed in all your speaking and all your knowledge. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,6 This proves that what we told you about Christ is true. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,7 Now you have every gift from God while you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to come again. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,"8 He will keep you strong until the end so that on the day when our Lord Jesus Christ comes, you will be free from all blame. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,"9 God is faithful. He is the one who has chosen you to share life with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. Stop Arguing With Each Other "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,"10 Brothers and sisters, by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, I beg all of you to agree with each other. You should not be divided into different groups. Be completely joined together again with the same kind of thinking and the same purpose. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,"11 My brothers and sisters, some members of Chloe’s family told me that there are arguments among you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,"12 This is what I mean One of you says, “I follow Paul,” and someone else says, “I follow Apollos.” Another says, “I follow Peter,” and someone else says, “I follow Christ.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,"13 Christ cannot be divided into different groups. It wasn’t Paul who died on the cross for you, was it? Were you baptized in Paul’s name? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,14 I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,"15 I am thankful because now no one can say that you were baptized in my name. 16 (I also baptized the family of Stephanas, but I don’t remember that I myself baptized any others.) "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,"16 (I also baptized the family of Stephanas, but I don’t remember that I myself baptized any others.) "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,"17 Christ did not give me the work of baptizing people. He gave me the work of telling the Good News. But he sent me to tell the Good News without using clever speech, which would take away the power that is in the cross† of Christ. God’s Power and Wisdom in Christ Jesus "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,18 The teaching about the cross seems foolish to those who are lost. But to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,"19 As the Scriptures say, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise. I will confuse the understanding of the intelligent.” Isaiah of the world look foolish. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,"21 This is what God in his wisdom decided Since the world did not find him through its own wisdom, he used the message that sounds foolish to save those who believe it. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,"22 The Jews ask for miraculous signs, and the Greeks want wisdom. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,"23 But this is the message we tell everyone Christ was killed on a cross. This message is a problem for Jews, and to other people it is nonsense. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,"24 But Christ is God’s power and wisdom to the people God has chosen, both Jews and Greeks. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,25 Even the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom. Even the weakness of God is stronger than human strength. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,"26 Brothers and sisters, God chose you to be his. Think about that! Not many of you were wise in the way the world judges wisdom. Not many of you had great influence, and not many of you came from important families. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,27 But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise. He chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,28 And God chose what the world thinks is not important—what the world hates and thinks is nothing. He chose these to destroy what the world thinks is important. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,29 God did this so that no one can stand before him and boast about anything. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,30 It is God who has made you part of Christ Jesus. And Christ has become for us wisdom from God. He is the reason we are right with God and pure enough to be in his presence. Christ is the one who set us free from sin. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,"31 So, as the Scriptures say, “Whoever boasts should boast only about the Lord.”✡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,2,2 My Message Jesus Christ on the Cross 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,3,"1 Dear brothers and sisters, when I came to you, I told you the secret truth of God. But I did not use fancy words or great wisdom. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,3,2 I decided that while I was with you I would forget about everything except Jesus Christ and his death on the cross. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,3,"3 When I came to you, I was weak and shook with fear. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,3,4 My teaching and my speaking were not with wise words that persuade people. But the proof of my teaching was the power that the Spirit gives. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,3,"5 I did this so that your faith would be in God’s power, not in human wisdom. God’s Wisdom "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,3,"6 We teach wisdom to people who are mature, but the wisdom we teach is not from this world. It is not the wisdom of the rulers of this world, who are losing their power. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,3,7 But we speak God’s secret wisdom that has been hidden from everyone until now. God planned this wisdom for our glory. He planned it before the world began. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,3,"8 None of the rulers of this world understood this wisdom. If they had understood it, they would not have killed our great and glorious Lord on a cross. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,3,"9 But as the Scriptures say, “No one has ever seen, no one has ever heard, no one has ever imagined what God has prepared for those who love him.” Isaiah is from God, not the spirit of the world. We received God’s Spirit so that we canknow all that God has given us."
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,3,"13 When we say this, we don’t use words taught to us by human wisdom. We use words taught to us by the Spirit. We use the Spirit’s words to explain spiritual truths. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,3,"14 People who do not have God’s Spirit do not accept the things that come from his Spirit. They think these things are foolish. They cannot understand them, because they can only be understood with the Spirit’s help. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,3,15 We who have the Spirit are able to make judgments about all these things. But anyone without the Spirit is not able to make proper judgments about us. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,3,"16 As the Scriptures say, “Who can know what is on the Lord’s mind? Who is able to give him advice?” Isaiah"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,3,16 You should know that you yourselves are God’s temple.* God’s Spirit lives in you. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,3,"17 If you destroy God’s temple, God will destroy you, because God’s temple is holy. You yourselves are God’s temple. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,3,18 Don’t fool yourselves. Whoever thinks they are wise in this world should become a fool. That’s the only way they can be wise. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,3,"19 I say this because the wisdom of this world is foolishness to God. As the Scriptures say, “He catches those who think they are wise in their own clever traps.”✡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,3,"20 The Scriptures also say, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise. He knows that their thoughts are worth nothing.”✡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,3,21 So there is not a person on earth that any of you should be boasting about. Everything is yours 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,3,"22 Paul, Apollos, Peter, the world, life, death, the present, and the future—all these are yours. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,3,"23 And you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,3,4 Apostles of Christ Jesus 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,4,"1 You should think of us as servants of Christ, the ones God has trusted to do the work of making known his secret truths. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,4,2 Those who are trusted with such an important work must show that they are worthy of that trust. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,4,3 But I don’t consider your judgment on this point to be worth anything. Even an opinion from a court of law would mean nothing. I don’t even trust my own judgment. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,4,"4 I don’t know of any wrong I have done, but that does not make me right. The Lord is the one who must decide if I have done well or not. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,4,5 So don’t judge anyone now. The time for judging will be when the Lord comes. He will shine light on everything that is now hidden in darkness. He will make known the secret purposes of our hearts. Then the praise each person should get will come from God. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,4,"6 Brothers and sisters, I have used Apollos and myself as examples for you. I did this so that you could learn from us the meaning of the words, “Follow what the Scriptures say.” Then you will not brag about one person and criticize another. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,4,"7 Who do you think you are? Everything you have was given to you. So, if everything you have was given to you, why do you act as if you got it all by your own power? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,4,8 You think you have everything you need. You think you are rich. You think you have become kings without us. I wish you really were kings. Then we could rule together with you. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,4,"9 But it seems to me that God has given me and the other apostles the last place. We are like prisoners condemned to die, led in a parade for the whole world to see—not just people but angels too. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,4,"10 We are fools for Christ, but you think you are so wise in Christ. We are weak, but you think you are so strong. People give you honor, but they don’t honor us. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,4,"11 Even now we still don’t have enough to eat or drink, and we don’t have enough clothes. We often get beatings. We have no homes. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,4,"12 We work hard with our own hands to feed ourselves. When people insult us, we ask God to bless them. When people treat us badly, we accept it. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,4,"13 When people say bad things about us, we try to say something that will help them. But people still treat us like the world’s garbage —everyone’s trash. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,4,"14 I am not trying to make you feel ashamed, but I am writing this to counsel you as my own dear children. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,4,"15 You may have ten thousand teachers in Christ, but you don’t have many fathers. Through the Good News I became your father in * Christ Jesus. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,4,16 So I beg you to be like me. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,4,17 That is why I am sending Timothy to you. He is my son in the Lord. I love him and trust him. He will help you remember the way I live in Christ Jesus—a way of life that I teach in every meeting of the church wherever I am. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,4,"18 Some of you are acting so proud, it seems as though you think I won’t be coming there again. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,4,"19 But I will come to you very soon, the Lord willing. Then I will see if these proud talkers have the power to do anything more than talk. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,4,20 God’s kingdom is not seen in talk but in power. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,4,"21 Which do you want that I come to you with punishment, or that I come with love and gentleness? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,4,5 Don’t Let Your People Live in Sin 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,5,1 I don’t want to believe what I am hearing—that there is sexual sin among you. And it is such a bad kind of sexual sin that even those who have never known God don’t allow it. People say that a man there has his father’s wife. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,5,2 And still you are proud of yourselves! You should have been filled with sadness. And the man who committed that sin should be put out of your group. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,5,"3 I cannot be there with you in person, but I am with you in spirit. And I have already judged the man who did this. I judged him the same as I would if I were really there. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,5,"4 Come together in the name of our Lord Jesus. I will be with you in spirit, and you will have the power of our Lord Jesus with you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,5,5 Then turn this man over to Satan. His sinful self* has to be destroyed so that his spirit will be saved on the day when the Lord comes again. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,5,"6 Your proud talk is not good. You know the saying, “Just a little yeast makes the whole batch of dough rise.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,5,"7 Take out all the old yeast, so that you will be a new batch of dough. You really are bread without yeast—Passover bread.† Yes, Christ our Passover Lamb‡ has already been killed. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,5,"8 So let us eat our Passover meal, but not with the bread that has the old yeast, the yeast of sin and wrongdoing. But let us eat the bread that has no yeast. This is the bread of goodness and truth. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,5,9 I wrote to you in my letter that you should not associate with people who sin sexually. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,5,"10 But I did not mean the people of this world. You would have to leave the world to get away from all the people who sin sexually, or who are greedy and cheat each other, or who worship idols. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,5,"11 I meant you must not associate with people who claim to be believers but continue to live in sin. Don’t even eat with a brother or sister who sins sexually, is greedy, worships idols, abuses others with insults, gets drunk, or cheats people. 12-"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,5,"13 It is not my business to judge those who are not part of the group of believers. God will judge them, but you must judge those who are part of your group. The Scriptures say, “Make the evil person leave your group.”✡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,5,6 Judging Problems Between Believers 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,6,"1 When one of you has something against someone else in your group, why do you go to the judges in the law courts? The way they think and live is wrong. So why do you let them decide who is right? Why don’t you let God’s holy people * decide who is right? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,6,"2 Don’t you know that God’s people will judge the world? So if you will judge the world, then surely you can judge small arguments like this. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,6,3 You know that in the future we will judge angels. So surely we can judge life’s ordinary problems. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,6,"4 So if you have such matters to be judged, why do you take them to those who are not part of the church? They mean nothing to you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,6,5 I say this to shame you. Surely there is someone in your group wise enough to judge a complaint between two believers. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,6,"6 But now one believer goes to court against another, and you let people who are not believers judge their case! "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,6,7 The lawsuits that you have against each other show that you are already defeated. It would be better for you to let someone wrong you. It would be better to let someone cheat you. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,6,8 But you are the ones doing wrong and cheating. And you do this to your own brothers and sisters in Christ! 9-
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,6,"10 Surely you know that people who do wrong will not get to enjoy God’s kingdom. Don’t be fooled. These are the people who will not get to enjoy his kingdom those who sin sexually, those who worship idols, those who commit adultery, men who let other men use them for sex or who have sex with other men, those who steal, those who are greedy, those who drink too much, those who abuse others with insults, and those who cheat. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,6,"11 In the past some of you were like that. But you were washed clean, you were made holy, and you were made right with God in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. Use Your Bodies for God’s Glory "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,6,"12 “I am allowed to do anything,” you say. My answer to this is that not all things are good. Even if it is true that “I am allowed to do anything,” I will not let anything control me like a slave. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,6,"13 Someone else says, “Food is for the stomach, and the stomach for food.” Yes, and God will destroy them both. But the body is not for sexual sin. The body is for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,6,14 And God will raise our bodies from death with the same power he used to raise the Lord Jesus. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,6,15 Surely you know that your bodies are parts of Christ himself. So I must never take what is part of Christ and join it to a prostitute! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,6,"16 The Scriptures say, “The two people will become one.”✡ So you should know that anyone who is joined with a prostitute becomes one with her in body. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,6,17 But anyone who is joined with the Lord is one with him in spirit. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,6,"18 So run away from sexual sin. It involves the body in a way that no other sin does. So if you commit sexual sin, you are sinning against your own body. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,6,19 You should know that your body is a temple* for the Holy Spirit that you received from God and that lives in you. You don’t own yourselves. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,6,20 God paid a very high price to make you his. So honor God with your body. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,6,7 About Marriage 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,1 Now I will discuss the things you wrote me about. You asked if it is better for a man not to have any sexual relations at all. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"2 But sexual sin is a danger, so each man should enjoy his own wife, and each woman should enjoy her own husband. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,3 The husband should give his wife what she deserves as his wife. And the wife should give her husband what he deserves as her husband. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,4 The wife does not have power over her own body. Her husband has the power over her ✡ body. And the husband does not have power over his own body. His wife has thepower over his body. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,5 Don’t refuse to give your bodies to each other. But you might both agree to stay away from sex for a while so that you can give your time to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not be able to tempt you in your weakness. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,6 I say this only to give you permission to be separated for a time. It is not a rule. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"7 I wish everyone could be like me. But God has given each person a different ability. He makes some able to live one way, others to live a different way. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,8 Now for those who are not married and for the widows I say this It is good for you to stay single like me. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"9 But if you cannot control your body, then you should marry. It is better to marry than to burn with sexual desire. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"10 Now, I have a command for those who are married. Actually, it is not from me; it is what the Lord commanded. A wife should not leave her husband. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"11 But if a wife does leave, she should remain single or get back together with her husband. And a husband should not divorce his wife. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"12 The advice I have for the others is from me. The Lord did not give us any teaching about this. If you have a wife who is not a believer, you should not divorce her if she will continue to live with you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"13 And if you have a husband who is not a believer, you should not divorce him if he will continue to live with you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"14 The husband who is not a believer is set apart for God through his believing wife. And the wife who is not a believer is set apart for God through her believing husband. If this were not true, your children would be unfit for God’s use. But now they are set apart for him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"15 But if the husband or wife who is not a believer decides to leave, let them leave. When this happens, the brother or sister in Christ is free. God chose you to have a life of peace. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"16 Wives, maybe you will save your husband; and husbands, maybe you will save your wife. You don’t know now what will happen later. Live as God Called You "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,17 But each one of you should continue to live the way the Lord God has given you to live—the way you were when God chose you. I tell people in all the churches to follow this rule. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"18 If a man was already circumcised when he was chosen, he should not change his circumcision. If a man was without circumcision when he was chosen, he should not be circumcised. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,19 It is not important if anyone is circumcised or not. What is important is obeying God’s commands. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,20 Each one of you should stay the way you were when God chose you. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"21 If you were a slave when God chose you, don’t let that bother you. But if you can be free, then do it. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"22 If you were a slave when the Lord chose you, you are now free in the Lord. You belong to the Lord. In the same way, if you were free when you were chosen, you are now Christ’s slave. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"23 God paid a high price for you, so don’t be slaves to anyone else. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"24 Brothers and sisters, in your new life with God, each one of you should continue the way you were when God chose you. Questions About Getting Married "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"25 Now I write about people who are not married.* I have no command from the Lord about this, but I give my opinion. And I can be trusted, because the Lord has given me mercy. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,26 This is a time of trouble. So I think it is good for you to stay the way you are. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"27 If you have a wife, don’t try to get free from her. If you are not married, don’t try to find a wife. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"28 But if you decide to marry, that is not a sin. And it is not a sin for a girl who has never married to get married. But * those who marry will have trouble in this life, and I want you to be free from thistrouble."
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"29 Brothers and sisters, this is what I mean We don’t have much time left. So starting now, those who have wives should be the same as those who don’t. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"30 It should not be important whether you are sad or whether you are happy. If you buy something, it should not matter to you that you own it. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"31 You should use the things of the world without letting them become important to you. This is how you should live, because this world, the way it is now, will soon be gone. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,32 I want you to be free from worry. A man who is not married is busy with the Lord’s work. He is trying to please the Lord. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,33 But a man who is married is busy with things of the world. He is trying to please his wife. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,34 He must think about two things—pleasing his wife and pleasing the Lord. A woman who is not married or a girl who has never married is busy with the Lord’s work. She wants to give herself fully—body and spirit—to the Lord. But a married woman is busy with things of the world. She is trying to please her husband. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"35 I am saying this to help you. I am not trying to limit you, but I want you to live in the right way. And I want you to give yourselves fully to the Lord without giving your time to other things. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,36 A man might think that he is not doing the right thing with his fiancée. She might be almost past the best age to marry.† So he might feel that he should marry her. He should do what he wants. It is no sin for them to get married. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"37 But another man might be more sure in his mind. There may be no need for marriage, so he is free to do what he wants. If he has decided in his own heart not to marry his fiancée, he is doing the right thing. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"38 So the man who marries his fiancée does right, and the man who does not marry does better. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"39 A woman should stay with her husband as long as he lives. But if the husband dies, the woman is free to marry any man she wants, but he should belong to the Lord. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,"40 The woman is happier if she does not marry again. This is my opinion, and I believe that I have God’s Spirit. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,7,8 About Food Offered to Idols 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,8,"1 Now I will write about meat that is sacrificed* to idols. It is certainly true that “we all have knowledge,” as you say. But this knowledge only fills people with pride. It is love that helps the church grow stronger. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,8,2 Those who think they know something do not yet know anything as they should. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,8,3 But whoever loves God is known by God. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,8,"4 So this is what I say about eating meat We know that an idol is really nothing in the world, and we know that there is only one God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,8,5 It’s really not important if there are things called gods in heaven or on earth—and there are many of these “gods” and “lords” out there. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,8,"6 For us there is only one God, and he is our Father. All things came from him, and we live for him. And there is only one Lord, Jesus Christ. All things were made through him, and we also have life through him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,8,"7 But not all people know this. Some have had the habit of worshiping idols. So now when they eat meat, they still feel as if it belongs to an idol. They are not sure that it is right to eat this meat. So when they eat it, they feel guilty. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,8,"8 But food will not bring us closer to God. Refusing to eat does not make us less pleasing to God, and eating does not make us closer to him. †"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,8,9 But be careful with your freedom. Your freedom to eat anything may make those who have doubts about what they can eat fall into sin. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,8,"10 You understand that it’s all right to eat anything, so you can eat even in an idol’s temple. But someone who has doubts might see you eating there, and this might encourage them to eat meat sacrificed to idols too. But they really think it is wrong. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,8,11 So this weak brother or sister—someone Christ died for—is lost because of your better understanding. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,8,"12 When you sin against your brothers and sisters in Christ in this way and you hurt them by causing them to do things they feel are wrong, you are also sinning against Christ. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,8,"13 So if the food I eat makes another believer fall into sin, I will never eat meat again. I will stop eating meat, so that I will not make my brother or sister sin. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,8,9 Rights That Paul Has Not Used 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,1 I am a free man. I am an apostle. I have seen Jesus our Lord. You people are an example of my work in the Lord. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,"2 Others may not accept me as an apostle, but surely you do. You are proof that I am an apostle in the Lord. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,3 Some people want to judge me. So this is the answer I give them 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,"4 We have the right to eat and drink, don’t we? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,"5 We have the right to bring a believing wife with us when we travel, don’t we? The other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Peter all do this. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,6 And are Barnabas and I the only ones who must work to earn our living? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,7 No soldier ever serves in the army and pays his own salary. No one ever plants a vineyard without eating some of the grapes himself. No one takes care of a flock of sheep without drinking some of the milk himself. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,8 These aren’t just my own thoughts. God’s law says the same thing. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,"9 Yes, it is written in the Law of Moses “When a work animal is being used to separate grain, don’t keep it from eating the grain.”✡ When God said this, was he thinking only about work animals? No. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,"10 He was really talking about us. Yes, that was written for us. The one who plows and the one who separates the grain should both expect to get some of the grain for their work. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,"11 We planted spiritual seed among you, so we should be able to harvest from you some things for this life. Surely that is not asking too much. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,"12 Others have this right to get things from you. So surely we have this right too. But we don’t use this right. No, we endure everything ourselves so that we will not stop anyone from obeying the Good News of Christ. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,13 Surely you know that those who work at the Temple get their food from the Temple. And those who serve at the altar get part of what is offered at the altar. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,14 It is the same with those who have the work of telling the Good News. The Lord has commanded that those who tell the Good News should get their living from this work. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,"15 But I have not used any of these rights, and I am not trying to get anything from you. That is not my purpose for writing this. I would rather die than to have someone take away what for me is a great source of pride. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,"16 It’s not my work of telling the Good News that gives me any reason to boast. That is my duty —something I must do. If I don’t tell people the Good News, I am in real trouble. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,"17 If I did it because it was my own choice, I would deserve to be paid. But I have no choice. I must tell the Good News. So I am only doing the duty that was given to me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,18 So what do I get for doing it? My reward is that when I tell people the Good News I can offer it to them for free and not use the rights that come with doing this work. ✡
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,"19 I am free. I belong to no other person, but I make myself a slave to everyone. I do this to help save as many people as I can. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,"20 To the Jews I became like a Jew so that I could help save Jews. I myself am not ruled by the law, but to those who are ruled by the law I became like someone who is ruled by the law. I did this to help save those who are ruled by the law. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,"21 To those who are without the law I became like someone who is without the law. I did this to help save those who are without the law. (But really, I am not without God’s law—I am ruled by the law of Christ.) "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,"22 To those who are weak, I became weak so that I could help save them. I have become all things to all people. I did this so that I could save people in any way possible. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,23 I do all this to make the Good News known. I do it so that I can share in the blessings of the Good News. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,"24 You know that in a race all the runners run, but only one runner gets the prize. So run like that. Run to win! "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,25 All who compete in the games use strict training. They do this so that they can win a prize—one that doesn’t last. But our prize is one that will last forever. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,"26 So I run like someone who has a goal. I fight like a boxer who is hitting something, not just the air. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,27 It is my own body I fight to make it do what I want. I do this so that I won’t miss getting the prize myself after telling others about it. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,9,10 Warning From History 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,"1 Brothers and sisters, I want you to know what happened to our ancestors who were with Moses. They were all under the cloud,* and they all walked through the sea. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,2 They were all baptized† into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,"3 They all ate the same spiritual food, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,"4 and they all drank the same spiritual drink. They drank from that spiritual rock that was with them, and that rock was Christ. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,"5 But God was not pleased with most of those people, so they were killed in the desert. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,6 And these things that happened are examples for us. These examples should stop us from wanting evil things like those people did. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,"7 Don’t worship idols as some of them did. As the Scriptures say, “The people sat down to eat and drink and then got up to have a wild party.”✡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,"8 We should not commit sexual sins as some of them did. In one day 23,"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,000 of them died because of their sin. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,"9 We should not test Christ‡ as some of them did. Because of that, they were killed by snakes. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,"10 And don’t complain as some of them did. Because they complained, they were killed by the angel that destroys. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,11 The things that happened to those people are examples. They were written to be warnings for us. We live in the time that all those past histories were pointing to. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,12 So anyone who thinks they are standing strong should be careful that they don’t fall. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,"13 The only temptations that you have are the same temptations that all people have. But you can trust God. He will not let you be tempted more than you can bear. But when you are tempted, God will also give you a way to escape that temptation. Then you will be able to endure it. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,"14 So, my dear friends, stay away from worshiping idols. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,15 You are intelligent people. Judge for yourselves the truth of what I say now. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,"16 The cup of blessing§ * that we give thanks for is a sharing in the blood sacrifice of Christ, isn’t it? Andthe bread that we break is a sharing in the body of Christ, isn’t it? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,"17 There is one loaf of bread, so we who are many are one body, because we all share in that one loaf. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,"18 And think about what the people of Israel do. When they eat the sacrifices,* they are united by sharing what was offered on the altar. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,"19 So, am I saying that sacrifices to idols are the same as those Jewish sacrifices? No, because an idol is nothing, and the things offered to idols are worth nothing. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,"20 But I am saying that when food is sacrificed to idols, it is an offering to demons, not to God. And I don’t want you to share anything with demons. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and then go drink a cup that honors demons. You cannot share a meal at the Lord’s table and then go share a meal that honors demons. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,22 Doing that would make the Lord jealous.† Do you really want to do that? Do you think we are stronger than he is? Use Your Freedom for God’s Glory 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,"23 “All things are allowed,” you say. But not all things are good. “All things are allowed.” But some things don’t help anyone. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,"24 Try to do what is good for others, not just what is good for yourselves. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,25 Eat any meat that is sold in the meat market. Don’t ask questions about it to see if it is something you think is wrong to eat. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,"26 You can eat it, “because the earth and everything in it belong to the Lord.”✡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,"27 Someone who is not a believer might invite you to eat with them. If you want to go, then eat anything that is put before you. Don’t ask questions to see if it is something you think is wrong to eat. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,"28 But if someone tells you, “That food was offered to idols,” then don’t eat it. That’s because some people think it is wrong, and it might cause a problem for the person who told you that. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,29 I don’t mean that you think it is wrong. But the other person might think it is wrong. That’s the only reason not to eat it. My own freedom should not be judged by what another person thinks. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,30 I eat the meal with thankfulness. So I don’t want to be criticized because of something I thank God for. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,"31 So if you eat, or if you drink, or if you do anything, do it for the glory of God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,"32 Never do anything that might make other people do wrong—Jews, non-Jews, or anyone in God’s church. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,10,33 I do the same thing. I try to please everyone in every way. I am not trying to do what is good for me. I am trying to do what is good for the most people so that they can be saved. 11 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"1 Follow my example, just as I follow the example of Christ. Being Under Authority "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,2 I praise you because you remember me in all things. You follow closely the teachings I gave you. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,3 But I want you to understand this The head of every man is Christ. And the head of a woman is the man.* And the head of Christ is God. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,4 Every man who prophesies or prays with his head covered brings shame to his head. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"5 But every woman who prays or prophesies should have her head covered. If her head is not covered, she brings shame to her head. Then she is the same as a woman who has her head shaved. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"6 If a woman does not cover her head, it * is the same as cutting off all her hair. But it is shameful for a woman to cut offher hair or to shave her head. So she should cover her head."
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"7 But a man should not cover his head, because he is made like God and is God’s glory. But woman is man’s glory. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,8 Man did not come from woman. Woman came from man. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,9 And man was not made for woman. Woman was made for man. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"10 So that is why a woman should have her head covered with something that shows she is under authority.† Also, she should do this because of the angels. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"11 But in the Lord the woman needs the man, and the man needs the woman. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"12 This is true because woman came from man, but also man is born from woman. Really, everything comes from God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,13 Decide this for yourselves Is it right for a woman to pray to God without something on her head? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,14 Even nature itself teaches you that wearing long hair is shameful for a man. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,15 But wearing long hair is a woman’s honor. Long hair is given to the woman to cover her head. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,16 Some people may still want to argue about this. But we and the churches of God don’t accept what those people are doing. The Lord’s Supper 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,17 In the things I tell you now I don’t praise you. Your meetings hurt you more than they help you. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"18 First, I hear that when you meet together as a church you are divided. And this is not hard to believe "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,19 because of your idea that you must have separate groups to show who the real believers are! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"20 When you all come together, it is not really the Lord’s Supper‡ you are eating. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"21 I say this because when you eat, each one eats without waiting for the others. Some people don’t get enough to eat or drink, while others have too much.§ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"22 You can eat and drink in your own homes. It seems that you think God’s church is not important. You embarrass those who are poor. What can I say? Should I praise you? No, I cannot praise you for this. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"23 The teaching I gave you is the same that I received from the Lord On the night when the Lord Jesus was handed over to be killed, he took bread "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"24 and gave thanks for it. Then he divided the bread and said, “This is my body; it is for you. Eat this to remember me.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"25 In the same way, after they ate, Jesus took the cup of wine. He said, “This cup represents the new agreement from God, which begins with my blood sacrifice. When you drink this, do it to remember me.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"26 This means that every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are telling others about the Lord’s death until he comes again. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"27 So if you eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in a way that does not fit its meaning, you are sinning against the body and the blood of the Lord. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"28 Before you eat the bread and drink the cup, you should examine your own attitude. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"29 If you eat and drink without paying attention to those who are the Lord’s body, your eating and drinking will cause you to be judged guilty. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"30 That is why many in your group are sick and weak, and many have died. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"31 But if we judged ourselves in the right way, then God would not judge us. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"32 But when the Lord judges us, he punishes us to show us the right way. He does this so that we will not be condemned with the world. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"33 So, my brothers and sisters, when you come together to eat, wait for each other. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,"34 If some are too hungry to wait, they should eat at home. Do this so that † your meeting together will not bring God’s judgment on you. I will tell you whatto do about the other things when I come."
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,11,12 Gifts From the Holy Spirit 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,"1 Now, brothers and sisters, I want you to understand about spiritual gifts. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,2 You remember the lives you lived before you were believers. You let yourselves be influenced and led away to worship idols—things that have no life. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,"3 So I tell you that no one who is speaking with the help of God’s Spirit says, “Jesus be cursed.” And no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” without the help of the Holy Spirit. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,"4 There are different kinds of spiritual gifts, but they are all from the same Spirit. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,"5 There are different ways to serve, but we serve the same Lord. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,"6 And there are different ways that God works in people, but it is the same God who works in all of us to do everything. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,7 Something from the Spirit can be seen in each person. The Spirit gives this to each one to help others. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,8 The Spirit gives one person the ability to speak with wisdom. And the same Spirit gives another person the ability to speak with knowledge. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,9 The same Spirit gives faith to one person and to another he gives gifts of healing. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,"10 The Spirit gives to one person the power to do miracles, to another the ability to prophesy, and to another the ability to judge what is from the Spirit and what is not. The Spirit gives one person the ability to speak in different kinds of languages, and to another the ability to interpret those languages. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,"11 One Spirit, the same Spirit, does all these things. The Spirit decides what to give each one. The Body of Christ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,"12 A person has only one body, but it has many parts. Yes, there are many parts, but all those parts are still just one body. Christ is like that too. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,13 Some of us are Jews and some of us are not; some of us are slaves and some of us are free. But we were all baptized to become one body through one Spirit. And we were all given* the one Spirit. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,14 And a person’s body has more than one part. It has many parts. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,"15 The foot might say, “I am not a hand, so I don’t belong to the body.” But saying this would not stop the foot from being a part of the body. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,"16 The ear might say, “I am not an eye, so I don’t belong to the body.” But saying this would not make the ear stop being a part of the body. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,"17 If the whole body were an eye, it would not be able to hear. If the whole body were an ear, it would not be able to smell anything. 18-"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,"19 If each part of the body were the same part, there would be no body. But as it is, God put the parts in the body as he wanted them. He made a place for each one. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,"20 So there are many parts, but only one body. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,"21 The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don’t need you!” And the head cannot say to the foot, “I don’t need you!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,"22 No, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are actually very important. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,23 And the parts that we think are not worth very much are the parts we give the most care to. And we give special care to the parts of the body that we don’t want to show. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,24 The more beautiful parts don’t need this special care. But God put the body together and gave more honor to the parts that need it. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,25 God did this so that our body would not be divided. God wanted the different parts to care the same for each other. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,"26 If one part of the * body suffers, then all the other parts suffer with it. Or if one part is honored,then all the other parts share its honor."
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,27 All of you together are the body of Christ. Each one of you is a part of that body. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,"28 And in the church God has given a place first to apostles, second to prophets, and third to teachers. Then God has given a place to those who do miracles, those who have gifts of healing, those who can help others, those who are able to lead, and those who can speak in different kinds of languages. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,29 Not all are apostles. Not all are prophets. Not all are teachers. Not all do miracles. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,30 Not all have gifts of healing. Not all speak in different kinds of languages. Not all interpret those languages. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,31 Continue to give your attention to the spiritual gifts you consider to be the greatest. But now I want to point out a way of life that is even greater. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,12,13 Let Love Be Your Guide 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,13,"1 I may speak in different languages, whether human or even of angels. But if I don’t have love, I am only a noisy bell or a ringing cymbal. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,13,"2 I may have the gift of prophecy, I may understand all secrets and know everything there is to know, and I may have faith so great that I can move mountains. But even with all this, if I don’t have love, I am nothing. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,13,"3 I may give away everything I have to help others, and I may even give my body as an offering to be burned. But I gain nothing by doing all this if I don’t have love. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,13,"4 Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous, it does not brag, and it is not proud. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,13,"5 Love is not rude, it is not selfish, and it cannot be made angry easily. Love does not remember wrongs done against it. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,13,"6 Love is never happy when others do wrong, but it is always happy with the truth. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,13,"7 Love never gives up on people. It never stops trusting, never loses hope, and never quits. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,13,"8 Love will never end. But all those gifts will come to an end—even the gift of prophecy, the gift of speaking in different kinds of languages, and the gift of knowledge. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,13,9 These will all end because this knowledge and these prophecies we have are not complete. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,13,"10 But when perfection comes, the things that are not complete will end. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,13,"11 When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, and I made plans like a child. When I became a man, I stopped those childish ways. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,13,"12 It is the same with us. Now we see God as if we are looking at a reflection in a mirror. But then, in the future, we will see him right before our eyes. Now I know only a part, but at that time I will know fully, as God has known me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,13,"13 So these three things continue faith, hope, and love. And the greatest of these is love. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,13,14 Use Spiritual Gifts to Help the Church 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"1 Love should be the goal of your life, but you should also want to have the gifts that come from the Spirit. And the gift you should want most is to be able to prophesy. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,2 I will explain why. Those who have the gift of speaking in a different language are not speaking to people. They are speaking to God. No one understands them—they are speaking secret things through the Spirit. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"3 But those who prophesy are speaking to people. They help people grow stronger in faith, and they give encouragement and comfort. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,4 Those who speak in a different language are helping only themselves. But those who prophesy are helping the whole church.
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"5 I would like all of you to have the gift of speaking in different languages. But what I want more is for you to prophesy. Anyone who prophesies is more important than those who can only speak in different languages. However, if they can also interpret those languages, they are as important as the one who prophesies. If they can interpret, then the church can be helped by what they say. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"6 Brothers and sisters, will it help you if I come to you speaking in different languages? No, it will help you only if I bring you a new truth or some knowledge, prophecy, or teaching. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"7 This is true even with lifeless things that make sounds —like a flute or a harp. If the different musical notes are not made clear, you can’t understand what song is being played. Each note must be played clearly for you to be able to understand the tune. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"8 And in a war, if the trumpet does not sound clearly, the soldiers will not know it is time to prepare for fighting. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"9 It is the same with you. If you don’t speak clearly in a language people know, they cannot understand what you are saying. You will be talking to the air! "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"10 It is true that there are many different languages in the world, and they all have meaning. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"11 But if I don’t understand the meaning of what someone is saying, it will just be strange sounds to me, and I will sound just as strange to them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,12 That’s why you who want spiritual gifts so much should prefer those gifts that help the church grow stronger. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,13 So those who have the gift of speaking in a different language should pray that they can also interpret what they say. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"14 If I pray in a different language, my spirit is praying, but my mind does nothing. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"15 So what should I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"16 You might be praising God with your spirit. But someone there without understanding cannot say “Amen” to your prayer of thanks, because they don’t know what you are saying. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"17 You may be thanking God in a good way, but others are not helped. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,18 I thank God that my gift of speaking in different kinds of languages is greater than any of yours. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"19 But in the church meetings I would rather speak five words that I understand than thousands of words in a different language. I would rather speak with my understanding, so that I can teach others. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"20 Brothers and sisters, don’t think like children. In evil things be like babies, but in your thinking you should be like full-grown adults. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"21 As the Scriptures* say, “Using those who speak a different language and using the lips of foreigners, I will speak to these people. But even then, they will not obey me.” Isaiah to them, and they will be judged by everything you say. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"25 The secret things in their heart will be made known. So they will bow down and worship God. They will say, “Without a doubt, God is here with you.”† Your Meetings Should Be Helpful to All "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"26 So, brothers and sisters, what should you do? When you meet together, one person has a song, another has a teaching, and another has a new truth from God. One person speaks in a different language, and another interprets that language. The purpose of whatever you do should be to help everyone grow stronger in faith. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"27 When you meet together, if anyone speaks to the group in a different language, it should be only two or no more than three people who do this. And they should speak one after the other. And someone else should interpret what they say. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"28 But if there is no interpreter, then anyone who speaks in a different language should be quiet in the church meeting. They should speak only to themselves and to God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,29 And only two or three prophets should speak. The others should judge what they say. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"30 And if a message from God comes to someone who is sitting, the first speaker should be quiet. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,31 You can all prophesy one after the other. This way everyone can be taught and encouraged. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,32 The spirits of prophets are under the control of the prophets themselves. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,33 God is not a God of confusion but a God of peace. This is the rule for all the meetings of God’s people. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"34 The women should keep quiet in these church meetings. They are not allowed to speak out but should be under authority, as the Law of Moses says. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"35 If there is something they want to know, they should ask their own husbands at home. It is shameful for a woman to speak up like that in the church meeting. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"36 God’s teaching did not come from you, and you are not the only ones who have received it. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"37 If you think you are a prophet or that you have a spiritual gift, you should understand that what I am writing to you is the Lord’s command. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"38 If you do not accept this, you will not be accepted. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,"39 So my brothers and sisters, continue to give your attention to prophesying. And don’t stop anyone from using the gift of speaking in different languages. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,40 But everything should be done in a way that is right and orderly. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,14,15 The Good News About Jesus Christ 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"1 Now, brothers and sisters, I want you to remember the Good News I told you. You received that Good News message, and you continue to base your life on it. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"2 That Good News, the message you heard from me, is God’s way to save you. But you must continue believing it. If you don’t, you believed for nothing. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"3 I gave you the message that I received. I told you the most important truths that Christ died for our sins, as the Scriptures say; "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"4 that he was buried and was raised to life on the third day, as the Scriptures say; "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,5 and that he appeared to Peter and then to the twelve apostles. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,6 After that Christ appeared to more than 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"500 other believers at the same time. Most of them are still living today, but some have died. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,7 Then he appeared to James and later to all the apostles. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"8 Last of all, he appeared to me. I was different, like a baby born before the normal time. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,9 All the other apostles are greater than I am. I say this because I persecuted the church of God. That is why I am not even good enough to be called an apostle. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"10 But, because of God’s grace, that is what I am. And his grace that he gave me † was not wasted. I worked harder than all the other apostles. (But I was notreally the one working. It was God’s grace that was with me.) "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"11 So then it is not important if I told you God’s message or if it was the other apostles who told you —we all tell people the same message, and this is what you believed. We Will Be Raised From Death "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,12 We tell everyone that Christ was raised from death. So why do some of you say that people will not be raised from death? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"13 If no one will ever be raised from death, then Christ has never been raised. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"14 And if Christ has never been raised, then the message we tell is worth nothing. And your faith is worth nothing. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"15 And we will also be guilty of lying about God, because we have told people about him, saying that he raised Christ from death. And if no one is raised from death, then God never raised Christ from death. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"16 If those who have died are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"17 And if Christ has not been raised from death, then your faith is for nothing; you are still guilty of your sins. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,18 And those in Christ who have already died are lost. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"19 If our hope in Christ is only for this life here on earth, then people should feel more sorry for us than for anyone else. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,20 But Christ really has been raised from death—the first one of all those who will be raised. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,21 Death comes to people because of what one man did. But now there is resurrection from death because of another man. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"22 I mean that in Adam all of us die. And in the same way, in Christ all of us will be made alive again. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"23 But everyone will be raised to life in the right order. Christ was first to be raised. Then, when Christ comes again, those who belong to him will be raised to life. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"24 Then the end will come. Christ will destroy all rulers, authorities, and powers. Then he will give the kingdom to God the Father. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,25 Christ must rule until God puts all enemies under his control.* 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,26 The last enemy to be destroyed will be death. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"27 As the Scriptures say, “God put everything under his control.”✡ When it says that “everything” is put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself. God is the one putting everything under Christ’s control. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"28 After everything has been put under Christ, then the Son himself will be put under God. God is the one who put everything under Christ. And Christ will be put under God so that God will be the complete ruler over everything. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"29 If no one will ever be raised from death, then what will the people do who are baptized for those who have died? If the dead are never raised, then why are people baptized for them? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,30 And what about us? Why do we put ourselves in danger every hour? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"31 I face death every day. That is true, brothers and sisters, just as it is true that I am proud of what you are because of Christ Jesus our Lord. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"32 I fought wild animals in Ephesus. If I did that only for human reasons, then I have gained nothing. If we are not raised from death, “Let us eat and drink, because tomorrow we die.”✡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,33 Don’t be fooled “Bad friends will ruin good habits.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,34 Come back to your right way of thinking and stop sinning. Some of you don’t know God. I say this to shame you. What Kind of Body Will We Have? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"35 But someone may ask, “How are the dead raised? What kind of body will they have?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"36 These are stupid questions. When you plant something, it must die in the ground before it can live and grow. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"37 And when you plant something, what you plant does not have the same “body” that it will have later. What you * plant is only a seed, maybe wheat or something else. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"38 But God gives it the body that he has planned for it, and he gives each kind of seed its own body. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"39 All things made of flesh are not the same People have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds have another, and fish have yet another kind. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"40 Also there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. But the beauty of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the beauty of the earthly bodies is another. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"41 The sun has one kind of beauty, the moon has another kind, and the stars have another. And each star is different in its beauty. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"42 It will be the same when those who have died are raised to life. The body that is “planted” in the grave will ruin and decay, but it will be raised to a life that cannot be destroyed. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"43 When the body is “planted,” it is without honor. But when it is raised, it will be great and glorious. When the body is “planted,” it is weak. But when it is raised, it will be full of power. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"44 The body that is “planted” is a physical body. When it is raised, it will be a spiritual body. There is a physical body. So there is also a spiritual body. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"45 As the Scriptures say, “The first man, Adam, became a living person.†”✡ But the last Adam‡ is a life-giving spirit. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,46 The spiritual man did not come first. It was the physical man that came first; then came the spiritual. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,47 The first man came from the dust of the earth. The second man came from heaven. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,48 All people belong to the earth. They are like that first man of earth. But those who belong to heaven are like that man of heaven. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"49 We were made like that man of earth, so we will also be made like that man of heaven. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"50 I tell you this, brothers and sisters Our bodies of flesh and blood cannot have a part in God’s kingdom. Something that will ruin cannot have a part in something that never ruins. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"51 But listen, I tell you this secret We will not all die, but we will all be changed. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,52 It will only take the time of a second. We will be changed as quickly as an eye blinks. This will happen when the last trumpet blows. The trumpet will blow and those who have died will be raised to live forever. And we will all be changed. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,53 This body that ruins must clothe itself with something that will never ruin. And this body that dies must clothe itself with something that will never die. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,15,"54 So this body that ruins will clothe itself with that which never ruins. And this body that dies will clothe itself with that which never dies. When this happens, the Scriptures will be made true “Death is swallowed in victory.” Isaiah"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,16,"1 Now, about the collection of money for God’s people Do the same as I told the Galatian churches to do. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,16,"2 On the first day of every week, each of you should take some of your money and put it in a special place. Save up as much as you can from what you are blessed with. Then you will not have to gather it all after I come. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,16,"3 When I arrive, I will send some men to take your gift to Jerusalem. These will be the ones you all agree should go. I will send them with letters of introduction. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,16,"4 If it seems good for me to go too, we can all travel together. Paul’s Plans "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,16,"5 I plan to go through Macedonia, so I will come to you after that. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,16,"6 Maybe I will stay with you for a time. I might even stay all winter. Then you can help me on my trip, wherever I go. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,16,"7 I don’t want to come see you now, because I would have to leave to go to other places. I hope to stay a longer time with you, if the Lord allows it. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,16,8 But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,16,"9 I will stay here, because a good opportunity for a great and growing work has been given to me now. And there are many people working against it. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,16,10 Timothy might come to you. Try to make him feel comfortable with you. He is working for the Lord the same as I am. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,16,11 So none of you should refuse to accept Timothy. Help him continue on his trip in peace so that he can come back to me. I am expecting him to come back with the other brothers. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,16,"12 Now about our brother Apollos I strongly encouraged him to visit you with the other brothers. He prefers not to come now, but he will come when he has the opportunity. Paul Ends His Letter "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,16,13 Be careful. Hold firmly to your faith. Have courage and be strong. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,16,14 Do everything in love. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,16,"15 You know that Stephanas and his family were the first believers in Achaia. They have given themselves to the service of God’s people. I ask you, brothers and sisters, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,16,16 to follow the leading of people like these and others who work hard and serve together with them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,16,"17 I am happy that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus have come. You are not here, but they have filled your place. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,16,18 They have been a great encouragement to me and to you as well. You should recognize the value of such people. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,1 Corinthians,16,19 The churches in Asia send you their greetings. Aquila and Priscilla greet you in the Lord. Also the church that meets in their house sends greetings.

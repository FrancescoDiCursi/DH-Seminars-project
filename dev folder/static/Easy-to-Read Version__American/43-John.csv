Easy-to-Read Version__American,John, JohnChrist Comes to the World,
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,"1 Before the world began, the Word* was there. The Word was with God, and the Word was God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,2 He was there with God in the beginning. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,"3 Everything was made through him, and nothing was made without him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,"4 In him there was life, and that life was a light for the people of the world. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,"5 The light† shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not defeated‡ it. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,"6 There was a man named John, who was sent by God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,7 He came to tell people about the light. Through him all people could hear about the light and believe. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,8 John was not the light. But he came to tell people about the light. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,9 The true light was coming into the world. This is the true light that gives light to all people. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,"10 The Word was already in the world. The world was made through him, but the world did not know him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,11 He came to the world that was his own. And his own people did not accept him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,"12 But some people did accept him. They believed in him, and he gave them the right to become children of God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,"13 They became God’s children, but not in the way babies are usually born. It was not because of any human desire or plan. They were born from God himself. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,14 The Word became a man and lived among us. We saw his divine greatness —the greatness that belongs to the only Son of the Father. The Word was full of grace and truth. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,"15 John told people about him. He said loudly, “This is the one I was talking about when I said, ‘The one who is coming after me is greater than I am, because he was living before I was even born.’ ” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,"16 Yes, the Word was full of grace and truth, and from him we all received one blessing after another.§ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,"17 That is, the law was given to us through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,18 No one has ever seen God. The only Son is the one who has shown us what God is like. He is himself God and is very close to the Father.* John Tells About the Messiah (Matthew “I am the voice of someone shouting in the desert‘Make a straight road ready for the Lord.’ ” Isaiah
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,"47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said, “This man coming is a true Israelite, one you can trust.†” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,"48 Nathanael asked, “How do you know me?” Jesus answered, “I saw you when you were under the fig tree, before Philip told you about me.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,"49 Then Nathanael said, “Teacher, you are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,"50 Jesus said to him, “Do you believe this just because I said I saw you under the fig tree? You will see much greater things than that!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,"51 Then he said, “Believe me when I say that you will all see heaven open. You will see ‘angels of God going up and coming down’✡ on the Son of Man.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,1,2 The Wedding at Cana 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"1 Two days later there was a wedding in the town of Cana in Galilee, and Jesus’ mother was there. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,2 Jesus and his followers were also invited. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"3 At the wedding there was not enough wine, so Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no more wine.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"4 Jesus answered, “Dear woman, why are you telling me this? It is not yet time for me to begin my work.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"5 His mother said to the servants, “Do what he tells you.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,6 There were six large stone waterpots there that were used by the Jews in their washing ceremonies.* Each one held about 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,20 or  30 gallons.† 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"7 Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the waterpots with water.” So they filled them to the top. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"8 Then he said to them, “Now dip out some water and take it to the man in charge of the feast.” So they did what he said. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"9 Then the man in charge tasted it, but the water had become wine. He did not know where the wine had come from, but the servants who brought the water knew. He called the bridegroom "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"10 and said to him, “People always serve the best wine first. Later, when the guests are drunk, they serve the cheaper wine. But you have saved the best wine until now.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"11 This was the first of all the miraculous signs Jesus did. He did it in the town of Cana in Galilee. By this he showed his divine greatness, and his followers believed in him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,12 Then Jesus went to the town of Capernaum. His mother and brothers and his followers went with him. They all stayed there a few days. Jesus at the Temple (Matthew “Take these things out of here! Don’t make my Father’s house a place for buyingand selling!”
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"17 When this happened, his followers remembered what was written in the Scriptures “My strong devotion to your Temple will destroy me.” Psalm"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"16 Yes, God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him would not be lost but have eternal life. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"17 God sent his Son into the world. He did not send him to judge the world guilty, but to save the world through him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"18 People who believe in God’s Son are not judged guilty. But people who do not believe are already judged, because they have not believed in God’s only Son. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"19 They are judged by this fact The light‡ has come into the world. But they did not want light. They wanted darkness, because they were doing evil things. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"20 Everyone who does evil hates the light. They will not come to the light, because the light will show all the bad things they have done. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,21 But anyone who follows the true way comes to the light. Then the light will show that whatever they have done was done through God. Jesus and John the Baptizer 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"22 After this, Jesus and his followers went into the area of Judea. There he stayed with his followers and baptized people. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"23 John was also baptizing people in Aenon, a place near Salim with plenty of water. People were going there to be baptized. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,24 This was before John was put in prison. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,25 Some of John’s followers had an argument with another Jew about religious washing.§ 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"26 Then they came to John and said, “Teacher, remember the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan River? He is the one you were telling everyone about. He is also baptizing people, and many are going to him.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"27 John answered, “A person can receive only what God gives. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"28 You yourselves heard me say, ‘I am not the Messiah. I am only the one God sent to prepare the way for him.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,29 The bride always belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who helps the bridegroom just waits and listens. He is happy just to hear the bridegroom talk. That’s how I feel now. I am so happy that he is here. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"30 He must become more and more important, and I must become less important. The One Who Comes From Heaven "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,31 “The one who comes from above is greater than all others. The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth. He talks about things that are on the earth. But the one who comes from heaven is greater than all others. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"32 He tells what he has seen and heard, but people don’t accept what he says. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,33 Whoever accepts what he says has given proof that God speaks the truth. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,"34 God sent him, and he tells people what God says. God gives him the Spirit fully. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,35 The Father loves the Son and has given him power over everything. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,36 Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life. But those who do not obey the Son will never have that life. They cannot get away from God’s anger.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,2,4 Jesus Talks to a Woman in Samaria 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"1 Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard the report that he was making and baptizing more followers than John. 2 (But really, Jesus himself did not baptize anyone; his followers baptized people for him.) "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"2 (But really, Jesus himself did not baptize anyone; his followers baptized people for him.) "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,3 So he left Judea and went back to Galilee. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"4 On the way to Galilee, he had to go through the country of Samaria. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"5 In Samaria Jesus came to the town called Sychar, which is near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"6 Jacob’s well was there. Jesus was tired from his long trip, so he sat down beside the well. It was about noon. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"7 A Samaritan ‡ woman came to the well to get some water, and Jesus said to her, “Please giveme a drink.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,8 This happened while his followers were in town buying some food. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"9 The woman answered, “I am surprised that you ask me for a drink! You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman!” (Jews have nothing to do with Samaritans.*) "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"10 Jesus answered, “You don’t know what God can give you. And you don’t know who I am, the one who asked you for a drink. If you knew, you would have asked me, and I would have given you living water.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"11 The woman said, “Sir, where will you get that living water? The well is very deep, and you have nothing to get water with. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"12 Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob? He is the one who gave us this well. He drank from it himself, and his sons and all his animals drank from it too.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"13 Jesus answered, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,14 But anyone who drinks the water I give will never be thirsty again. The water I give people will be like a spring flowing inside them. It will bring them eternal life.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"15 The woman said to Jesus, “Sir, give me this water. Then I will never be thirsty again and won’t have to come back here to get more water.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"16 Jesus told her, “Go get your husband and come back.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"17 The woman answered, “But I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You are right to say you have no husband. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"18 That’s because, although you have had five husbands, the man you live with now is not your husband. That much was the truth.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"19 The woman said, “Sir, I can see that you are a prophet.† "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,20 Our fathers worshiped on this mountain. But you Jews say that Jerusalem is the place where people must worship.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"21 Jesus said, “Believe me, woman! The time is coming when you will not have to be in Jerusalem or on this mountain to worship the Father. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"22 You Samaritans worship something you don’t understand. We Jews understand what we worship, since salvation comes from the Jews. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"23 But the time is coming when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth. In fact, that time is now here. And these are the kind of people the Father wants to be his worshipers. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,24 God is spirit. So the people who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"25 The woman said, “I know that the Messiah is coming.” (He is the one called Christ.) “When he comes, he will explain everything to us.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"26 Then Jesus said, “He is talking to you now—I am the Messiah.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"27 Just then Jesus’ followers came back from town. They were surprised because they saw Jesus talking with a woman. But none of them asked, “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"28 Then the woman left her water jar and went back to town. She told the people there, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,29 “A man told me everything I have ever done. Come see him. Maybe he is the Messiah.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,30 So the people left the town and went to see Jesus. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"31 While the woman was in town, Jesus’ followers were begging him, “Teacher, eat something!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"32 But Jesus answered, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"33 So the followers asked themselves, “Did someone already bring him some food?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"34 Jesus said, “My food is to do what the one who sent me wants me to do. My food is to finish the work that he gave me to do. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"35 When you plant, you always say, ‘Four more months to wait before we gather the grain.’ But I tell you, open your eyes, and look at the fields. They are ready for harvesting now. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"36 Even * now, the people who harvest the crop are being paid. They are gathering cropsfor eternal life. So now the people who plant can be happy together with thosewho harvest. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"37 It is true when we say, ‘One person plants, but another person harvests the crop.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"38 I sent you to harvest a crop that you did not work for. Others did the work, and you get the profit from their work.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"39 Many of the Samaritan people in that town believed in Jesus. They believed because of what the woman had told them about him. She had told them, “He told me everything I have ever done.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,40 The Samaritans went to Jesus. They begged him to stay with them. So he stayed there two days. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,41 Many more people became believers because of the things he said. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"42 The people said to the woman, “First we believed in Jesus because of what you told us. But now we believe because we heard him ourselves. We know now that he really is the one who will save the world.” Jesus Heals an Official’s Son (Matthew"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"7 The sick man answered, “Sir, there is no one to help me get into the water when it starts moving. I try to be the first one into the water. But when I try, someone else always goes in before I can.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"8 Then Jesus said, “Stand up! Pick up your mat and walk.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,9 Immediately the man was well. He picked up his mat and started walking. The day all this happened was a Sabbath day. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"10 So some Jews said to the man who had been healed, “Today is the Sabbath. It is against our law for you to carry your mat on the Sabbath day.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"11 But he answered, “The man who made me well told me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’ ” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"12 They asked him, “Who is the man who told you to pick up your mat and walk?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"13 But the man who had been healed did not know who it was. There were many people there, and Jesus had left. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"14 Later, Jesus found the man at the Temple and said to him, “See, you are well now. But stop sinning or something worse may happen to you!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,15 Then the man left and went back to the Jews who questioned him. He told them that Jesus was the one who made him well. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,16 Jesus was doing all this on the Sabbath day. So these Jews began trying to make him stop. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"17 But he said to them, “My Father never stops working, and so I work too.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"18 This made them try harder to kill him. They said, “First this man was breaking the law about the Sabbath day. Then he said that God is his Father! He is making himself equal with God!” Jesus Has God’s Authority "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"19 But Jesus answered, “I assure you that the Son can do nothing alone. He does only what he sees his Father doing. The Son does the same things that the Father does. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,20 The Father loves the Son and shows him everything he does. This man was healed. But the Father will show the Son greater things than this to do. Then you will all be amazed. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"21 The Father raises the dead and gives them life. In the same way, the Son gives life to those he wants to. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"22 “Also, the Father judges no one. He has given the Son power to do all the judging. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,23 God did this so that all people will respect the Son the same as they respect the Father. Anyone who does not respect the Son does not respect the Father. He is the one who sent the Son. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"24 “I assure you, anyone who hears what I say and believes in the one who sent me has eternal life. They will not be judged guilty. They have already left death and have entered into life. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"25 Believe me, an important time is coming. That time is already here. People who are dead will hear the voice of the Son of God. And those who listen will live. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,26 Life comes from the Father himself. So the Father has also allowed the Son to give life. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,27 And the Father has given him the power to judge all people because he is the Son of Man. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,28 “Don’t be surprised at this. A time is coming when all people who are dead and in their graves will hear his voice. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,29 Then they will come out of their graves. Those who did good in this life will rise and have eternal life. But those who did evil will rise to be judged guilty. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"30 “I can do nothing alone. I judge only the way I am told. And my judgment is right, because I am not trying to please myself. I want only to please the one who sent me. Jesus Says More to the Jewish Leaders"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"31 “If I tell people about myself, they cannot be sure that what I say is true. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"32 But there is someone else who tells people about me, and I know that what he says about me is true. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"33 “You sent men to John, and he told you what is true. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"34 I don’t need anyone to tell people about me, but I remind you of what John said so that you can be saved. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"35 John was like a lamp that burned and gave light, and you were happy to enjoy his light for a while. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,36 “But I have a proof about myself that is greater than anything John said. The things I do are my proof. These are what my Father gave me to do. They show that the Father sent me. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,37 And the Father who sent me has given proof about me himself. But you have never heard his voice. You have never seen what he looks like. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"38 The Father’s teaching does not live in you, because you don’t believe in the one the Father sent. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,39 You carefully study the Scriptures. You think that they give you eternal life. These same Scriptures tell about me! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,40 But you refuse to come to me to have that life. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,41 “I don’t want praise from you or any other human. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,42 But I know you—I know that you have no love for God. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"43 I have come from my Father and speak for him, but you don’t accept me. But when other people come speaking only for themselves, you accept them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,44 You like to have praise from each other. But you never try to get the praise that comes from the only God. So how can you believe? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,45 Don’t think that I will be the one to stand before the Father and accuse you. Moses is the one to accuse you. And he is the one you hoped would save you. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"46 If you really believed Moses, you would believe me, because he wrote about me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"47 But you don’t believe what he wrote, so you can’t believe what I say.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,6 Jesus Feeds More Than 5000 (Matthew
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,7 (Matthew
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"14 The people saw this miraculous sign that Jesus did and said, “He must be the Prophet* who is coming into the world.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,15 Jesus knew that the people planned to come get him and make him their king. So he left and went into the hills alone. Jesus Walks on Water (Matthew my people. Every one of them will come to me. I will always accept them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"38 I came down from heaven to do what God wants, not what I want. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,39 I must not lose anyone God has given me. But I must raise them up on the last day. This is what the one who sent me wants me to do. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,40 Everyone who sees the Son and believes in him has eternal life. I will raise them up on the last day. This is what my Father wants.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"41 Some Jews began to complain about Jesus because he said, “I am the bread that comes down from heaven.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"42 They said, “This is Jesus. We know his father and mother. He is only Joseph’s son. How can he say, ‘I came down from heaven’?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"43 But Jesus said, “Stop complaining to each other. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"44 The Father is the one who sent me, and he is the one who brings people to me. I will raise them up on the last day. Anyone the Father does not bring to me cannot come to me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,45 It is written in the prophets ‘God will teach them all.’✡ People listen to the Father and learn from him. They are the ones who come to me. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,46 I don’t mean that there is anyone who has seen the Father. The only one who has ever seen the Father is the one who came from God. He has seen the Father. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,47 “I can assure you that anyone who believes has eternal life. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,48 I am the bread that gives life. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"49 Your ancestors ate the manna God gave them in the desert, but it didn’t keep them from dying. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,50 Here is the bread that comes down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will never die. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This bread is my body. I will give my body so that the people in the world can have life.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"52 Then the Jews began to argue among themselves. They said, “How can this man give us his body to eat?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"53 Jesus said, “Believe me when I say that you must eat the body of the Son of Man, and you must drink his blood. If you don’t do this, you have no real life. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,54 Those who eat my body and drink my blood have eternal life. I will raise them up on the last day. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"55 My body is true food, and my blood is true drink. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"56 Those who eat my body and drink my blood live in me, and I live in them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"57 “The Father sent me. He lives, and I live because of him. So everyone who eats me will live because of me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"58 I am not like the bread that your ancestors ate. They ate that bread, but they still died. I am the bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,59 Jesus said all this while he was teaching in the synagogue in the city of Capernaum. Many Followers Leave Jesus 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"60 When Jesus’ followers heard this, many of them said, “This teaching is hard. Who can accept it?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"61 Jesus already knew that his followers were complaining about this. So he said, “Is this teaching a problem for you? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,62 Then what will you think when you see the Son of Man going up to where he came from? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"63 It is the Spirit that gives life. The body is of no value for that. But the things I have told you are from the Spirit, so they give life. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,64 But some of you don’t believe.” (Jesus knew the people who did not believe. He knew this from the beginning. And he knew the one who would hand him over to his enemies.) 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"65 Jesus said, “That is why I said, ‘Anyone the Father does not help to come to me cannot come.’ ” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"66 After Jesus said these things, many of his followers left and stopped following him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"67 Jesus asked the twelve apostles, “Do you want to leave too?” ✡"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"68 Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, where would we go? You have the words that give eternal life. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,69 We believe in you. We know that you are the Holy One from God.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"70 Then Jesus answered, “I chose all twelve of you. But one of you is a devil.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,"71 He was talking about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. Judas was one of the twelve apostles, but later he would hand Jesus over to his enemies. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,3,7 Jesus and His Brothers 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"1 After this, Jesus traveled around the country of Galilee. He did not want to travel in Judea, because the Jewish leaders there wanted to kill him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,2 It was time for the Jewish Festival of Shelters. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"3 So his brothers said to him, “You should leave here and go to the festival in Judea. Then your followers there can see the miracles you do. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"4 If you want to be well known, you must not hide what you do. So, if you can do such amazing things, let the whole world see you do them.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,5 Jesus’ brothers said this because even they did not believe in him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"6 Jesus said to them, “The right time for me has not yet come, but any time is right for you to go. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"7 The world cannot hate you. But the world hates me, because I tell the people in the world that they do evil things. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"8 So you go to the festival. I will not go now, because the right time for me has not yet come.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"9 After Jesus said this, he stayed in Galilee. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"10 So his brothers left to go to the festival. After they left, Jesus went too, but he did not let people see him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"11 At the festival the Jewish leaders were looking for him. They said, “Where is that man?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"12 There was a large group of people there. Many of them were talking secretly to each other about Jesus. Some people said, “He is a good man.” But others said, “No, he fools the people.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,13 But no one was brave enough to talk about him openly. They were afraid of the Jewish leaders. Jesus Teaches in Jerusalem 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"14 When the festival was about half finished, Jesus went to the Temple area and began to teach. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"15 The Jewish leaders were amazed and said, “How did this man learn so much? He never had the kind of teaching we had!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"16 Jesus answered, “What I teach is not my own. My teaching comes from the one who sent me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,17 People who really want to do what God wants will know that my teaching comes from God. They will know that this teaching is not my own. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"18 If I taught my own ideas, I would just be trying to get honor for myself. But if I am trying to bring honor to the one who sent me, I can be trusted. Anyone doing that is not going to lie. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"19 Moses gave you the law, right? But you don’t obey that law. If you do, then why are you trying to kill me?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"20 The people answered, “A demon is making you crazy! We are not trying to kill you.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"21 Jesus said to them, “I did one miracle on a Sabbath day, and you were all surprised. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"22 But you obey the law Moses gave you about circumcision—and sometimes you do it on a Sabbath day. (Really, Moses is not the one who gave you circumcision. It came from our ancestors who lived before Moses.) Yes, you often circumcise baby boys on a Sabbath day. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,23 This shows that someone can be circumcised on a Sabbath day to obey the Law of Moses. So why are you angry with me for healing a person’s whole body on the Sabbath day? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,24 Stop judging by the way things look. Be fair and judge by what is really right.” People Wonder if Jesus Is the Messiah
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"25 Then some of the people who lived in Jerusalem said, “This is the man they are trying to kill. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,26 But he is teaching where everyone can see and hear him. And no one is trying to stop him from teaching. Maybe the leaders have decided that he really is the Messiah. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"27 But when the real Messiah comes, no one will know where he comes from. And we know where this man’s home is.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"28 Jesus was still teaching in the Temple area when he said loudly, “Do you really know me and where I am from? I am here, but not by my own decision. I was sent by one who is very real. But you don’t know him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,29 I know him because I am from him. He is the one who sent me.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"30 When Jesus said this, the people tried to grab him. But no one was able even to touch him, because the right time for him had not yet come. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"31 But many of the people believed in Jesus. They said, “We are waiting for the Messiah to come. When he comes, will he do more miraculous signs than this man has done?” The Jewish Leaders Try to Arrest Jesus "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,32 The Pharisees heard what the people were saying about Jesus. So the leading priests and the Pharisees sent some Temple police to arrest him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"33 Then Jesus said, “I will be with you a little while longer. Then I will go back to the one who sent me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"34 You will look for me, but you will not find me. And you cannot come where I am.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"35 These Jews said to each other, “Where will this man go that we cannot find him? Will he go to the Greek cities where our people live? Will he teach the Greek people there? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"36 He says, ‘You will look for me, but you will not find me.’ He also says, ‘You cannot come where I am.’ What does this mean?” Jesus Talks About the Holy Spirit "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"37 The last day of the festival came. It was the most important day. On that day Jesus stood up and said loudly, “Whoever is thirsty may come to me and drink. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"38 If anyone believes in me, rivers of living water will flow out from their heart. That is what the Scriptures say.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"39 Jesus was talking about the Spirit. The Spirit had not yet been given to people, because Jesus had not yet been raised to glory. But later, those who believed in Jesus would receive the Spirit. The People Argue About Jesus "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"40 When the people heard the things that Jesus said, some of them said, “This man really is the Prophet.*” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"41 Other people said, “He is the Messiah.” And others said, “The Messiah will not come from Galilee. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"42 The Scriptures say that the Messiah will come from the family of David. And they say that he will come from Bethlehem, the town where David lived.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,43 So the people did not agree with each other about Jesus. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,44 Some of the people wanted to arrest him. But no one tried to do it. The Jewish Leaders Refuse to Believe 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"45 The Temple police went back to the leading priests and the Pharisees. The priests and the Pharisees asked, “Why didn’t you bring Jesus?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"46 The Temple police answered, “We have never heard anyone say such amazing things!” *"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"47 The Pharisees answered, “So he has fooled you too! "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"48 You don’t see any of the leaders or any of us Pharisees believing in him, do you? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,49 But those people out there know nothing about the law. They are under God’s curse!” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"50 But Nicodemus was there in that group. He was the one who had gone to see Jesus before.† He said, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,51 “Our law will not let us judge anyone without first hearing them and finding out what they have done.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,"52 The Jewish leaders answered, “You must be from Galilee too! Study the Scriptures. You will find nothing about a prophet‡ coming from Galilee.” A Woman Caught in Adultery "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,4,53 Then they all left and went home. 8 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,1 Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"2 Early in the morning he went back to the Temple area. The people all came to him, and he sat and taught them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,3 The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought a woman they had caught in bed with a man who was not her husband. They forced her to stand in front of the people. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"4 They said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,5 The Law of Moses commands us to stone to death any such woman. What do you say we should do?” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,6 They were saying this to trick Jesus. They wanted to catch him saying something wrong so that they could have a charge against him. But Jesus stooped down and started writing on the ground with his finger. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"7 The Jewish leaders continued to ask him their question. So he stood up and said, “Anyone here who has never sinned should throw the first stone at her.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,8 Then Jesus stooped down again and wrote on the ground. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"9 When they heard this, they began to leave one by one. The older men left first, and then the others. Jesus was left alone with the woman standing there in front of him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"10 He looked up again and said to her, “Where did they all go? Did no one judge you guilty?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"11 She answered, “No one, sir.” Then Jesus said, “I don’t judge you either. You can go now, but don’t sin again.”* Jesus Is the Light of the World "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"12 Later, Jesus talked to the people again. He said, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never live in darkness. They will have the light that gives life.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"13 But the Pharisees said to Jesus, “When you talk about yourself, you are the only one to say that these things are true. So we cannot accept what you say.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"14 Jesus answered, “Yes, I am saying these things about myself. But people can believe what I say, because I know where I came from. And I know where I am going. But you don’t know where I came from or where I am going. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,15 You judge me the way people judge other people. I don’t judge anyone. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"16 But if I judge, my judging is true, because when I judge I am not alone. The Father who sent me is with me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"17 Your own law says that when two witnesses say the same thing, you must accept what they say. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,18 I am one of the witnesses who speaks about myself. And the Father who sent me is my other witness.” †
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"19 The people asked, “Where is your father?” Jesus answered, “You don’t know me or my Father. But if you knew me, you would know my Father too.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"20 Jesus said these things while he was teaching in the Temple area, near the room where the Temple offerings were kept. But no one arrested him, because the right time for him had not yet come. Some Jews Don’t Understand Jesus "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"21 Again, Jesus said to the people, “I will leave you. You will look for me, but you will die in your sin. You cannot come where I am going.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"22 So the Jewish leaders asked themselves, “Will he kill himself? Is that why he said, ‘You cannot come where I am going’?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"23 But Jesus said to them, “You people are from here below, but I am from above. You belong to this world, but I don’t belong to this world. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"24 I told you that you would die in your sins. Yes, if you don’t believe that I AM,† you will die in your sins.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"25 They asked, “Then who are you?” Jesus answered, “I am what I have told you from the beginning. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"26 I have much more I could say to judge you. But I tell people only what I have heard from the one who sent me, and he speaks the truth.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,27 They did not understand who he was talking about. He was telling them about the Father. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"28 So he said to them, “You will lift up‡ the Son of Man. Then you will know that I AM. You will know that whatever I do is not by my own authority. You will know that I say only what the Father has taught me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,29 The one who sent me is with me. I always do what pleases him. So he has not left me alone.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"30 While he was saying these things, many people believed in him. Jesus Talks About Freedom From Sin "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"31 So Jesus said to the Jews who believed in him, “If you continue to accept and obey my teaching, you are really my followers. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"32 You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"33 They answered, “We are Abraham’s descendants. And we have never been slaves. So why do you say that we will be free?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"34 Jesus said, “The truth is, everyone who sins is a slave—a slave to sin. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,35 A slave does not stay with a family forever. But a son belongs to the family forever. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"36 So if the Son makes you free, you are really free. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"37 I know you are Abraham’s descendants. But you want to kill me, because you don’t want to accept my teaching. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,38 I am telling you what my Father has shown me. But you do what your father has told you.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"39 They said, “Our father is Abraham.” Jesus said, “If you were really Abraham’s descendants, you would do what Abraham did. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,40 I am someone who has told you the truth I heard from God. But you are trying to kill me. Abraham did nothing like that. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"41 So you are doing what your own father did.” But they said, “We are not like children who never knew who their father was. God is our Father. He is the only Father we have.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"42 Jesus said to them, “If God were really your Father, you would love me. I came from God, and now I am here. I did not come by my own authority. God sent me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"43 You don’t understand the things I say, because you cannot accept my † teaching. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"44 Your father is the devil. You belong to him. You want to do what he wants. He was a murderer from the beginning. He was always against the truth. There is no truth in him. He is like the lies he tells. Yes, the devil is a liar. He is the father of lies. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"45 “I am telling you the truth, and that’s why you don’t believe me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"46 Can any of you prove that I am guilty of sin? If I tell the truth, why don’t you believe me? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"47 Whoever belongs to God accepts what he says. But you don’t accept what God says, because you don’t belong to God.” Jesus Talks About Himself and Abraham "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"48 The Jews there answered, “We say you are a Samaritan. We say a demon is making you crazy! Are we not right when we say this?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"49 Jesus answered, “I have no demon in me. I give honor to my Father, but you give no honor to me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,50 I am not trying to get honor for myself. There is one who wants this honor for me. He is the judge. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"51 I promise you, whoever continues to obey my teaching will never die.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"52 The Jews said to Jesus, “Now we know that you have a demon in you! Even Abraham and the prophets died. But you say, ‘Whoever obeys my teaching will never die.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"53 Do you think you are greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"54 Jesus answered, “If I give honor to myself, that honor is worth nothing. The one who gives me honor is my Father. And you say that he is your God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"55 But you don’t really know him. I know him. If I said I did not know him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know him, and I obey what he says. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,56 Your father Abraham was very happy that he would see the day when I came. He saw that day and was happy.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"57 The Jews said to Jesus, “What? How can you say you have seen Abraham? You are not even  50 years old!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"58 Jesus answered, “The fact is, before Abraham was born, I AM.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,"59 When he said this, they picked up stones to throw at him. But Jesus hid, and then he left the Temple area. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,5,9 Jesus Heals a Man Born Blind 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"1 While Jesus was walking, he saw a man who had been blind since the time he was born. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"2 Jesus’ followers asked him, “Teacher, why was this man born blind? Whose sin made it happen? Was it his own sin or that of his parents?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"3 Jesus answered, “It was not any sin of this man or his parents that caused him to be blind. He was born blind so that he could be used to show what great things God can do. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"4 While it is daytime, we must continue doing the work of the one who sent me. The night is coming, and no one can work at night. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"5 While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"6 After Jesus said this, he spit on the dirt, made some mud and put it on the man’s eyes. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"7 Jesus told him, “Go and wash in Siloam pool.” (Siloam means “Sent.”) So the man went to the pool, washed and came back. He was now able to see. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"8 His neighbors and some others who had seen him begging said, “Look! Is this the same man who always sits and begs?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"9 Some people said, “Yes! He is the one.” But others said, “No, he can’t be the same man. He only looks like him.” So the man himself said, “I am that same man.”"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"10 They asked, “What happened? How did you get your sight?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"11 He answered, “The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. Then he told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went there and washed. And then I could see.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"12 They asked him, “Where is this man?” He answered, “I don’t know.” Some Pharisees Have Questions "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,13 Then the people brought the man to the Pharisees. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,14 The day Jesus had made mud and healed the man’s eyes was a Sabbath day. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"15 So the Pharisees asked the man, “How did you get your sight?” He answered, “He put mud on my eyes. I washed, and now I can see.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"16 Some of the Pharisees said, “That man does not obey the law about the Sabbath day. So he is not from God.” Others said, “But someone who is a sinner cannot do these miraculous signs.” So they could not agree with each other. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"17 They asked the man again, “Since it was your eyes he healed, what do you say about him?” He answered, “He is a prophet.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,18 The Jewish leaders still did not believe that this really happened to the man —that he was blind and was now healed. But later they sent for his parents. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"19 They asked them, “Is this your son? You say he was born blind. So how can he see?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"20 His parents answered, “We know that this man is our son. And we know that he was born blind. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,21 But we don’t know why he can see now. We don’t know who healed his eyes. Ask him. He is old enough to answer for himself.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,22 They said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. The leaders had already decided that they would punish anyone who said Jesus was the Messiah. They would stop them from coming to the synagogue. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"23 That is why his parents said, “He is old enough. Ask him.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"24 So the Jewish leaders called the man who had been blind. They told him to come in again. They said, “You should honor God by telling the truth. We know that this man is a sinner.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"25 The man answered, “I don’t know if he is a sinner. But I do know this I was blind, and now I can see.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"26 They asked, “What did he do to you? How did he heal your eyes?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"27 He answered, “I have already told you that. But you would not listen to me. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to be his followers too?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"28 At this they shouted insults at him and said, “You are his follower, not us! We are followers of Moses. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,29 We know that God spoke to Moses. But we don’t even know where this man comes from!” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"30 The man answered, “This is really strange! You don’t know where he comes from, but he healed my eyes. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"31 We all know that God does not listen to sinners, but he will listen to anyone who worships and obeys him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,32 This is the first time we have ever heard of anyone healing the eyes of someone born blind. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"33 This man must be from God. If he were not from God, he could not do anything like this.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"34 The Jewish leaders answered, “You were born full of sin! Are you trying to teach us?” And they told the man to get out of the synagogue and to stay out. Spiritual Blindness "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"35 When Jesus heard that they had forced the man to leave, he found him and asked him, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"36 The man said, “Tell me who he is, sir, so I can believe in him.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"37 Jesus said to him, “You have already seen him. The Son of Man is the one talking with you now.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"38 The man answered, “Yes, I believe, Lord!” Then he bowed and worshiped Jesus. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"39 Jesus said, “I came into this world so that the world could be judged. I came so that people who are blind* could see. And I came so that people who think they see would become blind.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"40 Some of the Pharisees were near Jesus. They heard him say this. They asked, “What? Are you saying that we are blind too?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,"41 Jesus said, “If you were really blind, you would not be guilty of sin. But you say that you see, so you are still guilty.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,6,10 The Shepherd and His Sheep 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"1 Jesus said, “It is certainly true that when a man enters the sheep pen, he should use the gate. If he climbs in some other way, he is a robber. He is trying to steal the sheep. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,2 But the man who takes care of the sheep enters through the gate. He is the shepherd. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"3 The man who guards the gate opens the gate for the shepherd. And the sheep listen to the voice of the shepherd. He calls his own sheep, using their names, and he leads them out. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"4 He brings all of his sheep out. Then he goes ahead of them and leads them. The sheep follow him, because they know his voice. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"5 But sheep will never follow someone they don’t know. They will run away from him, because they don’t know his voice.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"6 Jesus told the people this story, but they did not understand what it meant. Jesus Is the Good Shepherd "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"7 So Jesus said again, “I assure you, I am the gate for the sheep. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,8 All those who came before me were thieves and robbers. The sheep did not listen to them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,9 I am the gate. Whoever enters through me will be saved. They will be able to come in and go out. They will find everything they need. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"10 A thief comes to steal, kill, and destroy. But I came to give life—life that is full and good. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"11 “I am the good shepherd, and the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"12 The worker who is paid to keep the sheep is different from the shepherd. The paid worker does not own the sheep. So when he sees a wolf coming, he runs away and leaves the sheep alone. Then the wolf attacks the sheep and scatters them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,13 The man runs away because he is only a paid worker. He does not really care for the sheep. 14-
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,15 “I am the shepherd who cares for the sheep. I know my sheep just as the Father knows me. And my sheep know me just as I know the Father. I give my life for these sheep. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,16 I have other sheep too. They are not in this flock here. I must lead them also. They will listen to my voice. In the future there will be one flock and one shepherd.* 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,17 The Father loves me because I give my life. I give my life so that I can get it back again. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"18 No one takes my life away from me. I give my own life freely. I have the right to give my life, and I have the right to get it back again. This is what the Father told me.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,19 Again the Jews were divided over what Jesus was saying. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"20 Many of them said, “A demon has come into him and made him crazy. Why listen to him?” *"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"21 But others said, “These aren’t the words of someone controlled by a demon. A demon cannot heal the eyes of a blind man.” The Jewish Leaders Against Jesus "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"22 It was winter, and the time came for the Festival of Dedication† at Jerusalem. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,23 Jesus was in the Temple area at Solomon’s Porch. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"24 The Jewish leaders gathered around him. They said, “How long will you make us wonder about you? If you are the Messiah, then tell us clearly.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"25 Jesus answered, “I told you already, but you did not believe. I do miracles in my Father’s name. These miracles show who I am. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"26 But you do not believe, because you are not my sheep. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"27 My sheep listen to my voice. I know them, and they follow me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"28 I give my sheep eternal life. They will never die, and no one can take them out of my hand. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"29 My Father is the one who gave them to me, and he is greater than all.‡ No one can steal my sheep out of his hand. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,30 The Father and I are one.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,31 Again the Jews there picked up stones to kill Jesus. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"32 But he said to them, “The many wonderful things you have seen me do are from the Father. Which of these good things are you killing me for?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"33 They answered, “We are not killing you for any good thing you did. But you say things that insult God. You are only a man, but you say you are the same as God! That is why we are trying to kill you!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"34 Jesus answered, “It is written in your law that God said, ‘I said you are gods.’✡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,35 This Scripture called those people gods —the people who received God’s message. And Scripture is always true. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"36 So why do you accuse me of insulting God for saying, ‘I am God’s Son’? I am the one God chose and sent into the world. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"37 If I don’t do what my Father does, then don’t believe what I say. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"38 But if I do what my Father does, you should believe in what I do. You might not believe in me, but you should believe in the things I do. Then you will know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"39 They tried to get Jesus again, but he escaped from them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"40 Then he went back across the Jordan River to the place where John began his work of baptizing people. Jesus stayed there, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,"41 and many people came to him. They said, “John never did any miraculous signs, but everything John said about this man is true.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,42 And many people there believed in Jesus. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,7,11 The Death of Lazarus 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"1 There was a man named Lazarus who was sick. He lived in the town of Bethany, where Mary and her sister Martha lived. 2 (Mary is the same woman who put perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.) Mary’s brother was Lazarus, the man who was now sick. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"2 (Mary is the same woman who put perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.) Mary’s brother was Lazarus, the man who was now sick. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"3 So Mary and Martha sent someone to tell Jesus, “Lord, your dear friend Lazarus is sick.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"4 When Jesus heard this he said, “The end of this sickness will not be death. No, this sickness is for the glory of God. This has happened to bring glory to the Son of God.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,5 Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"6 So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"7 and then said to his followers, “We should go back to Judea.” †"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"8 They answered, “But Teacher, those Jews there tried to stone you to death. That was only a short time ago. Now you want to go back there?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"9 Jesus answered, “There are twelve hours of light in the day. Whoever walks in the day will not stumble and fall because they can see with the light from the sun.* "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,10 But whoever walks at night will stumble because there is no light.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"11 Then Jesus said, “Our friend Lazarus is now sleeping, but I am going there to wake him.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"12 The followers answered, “But, Lord, if he can sleep, he will get well.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"13 They thought Jesus meant that Lazarus was literally sleeping, but he really meant that Lazarus was dead. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"14 So then Jesus said plainly, “Lazarus is dead. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,15 And I am glad I was not there. I am happy for you because now you will believe in me. We will go to him now.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"16 Then Thomas, the one called “Twin,” said to the other followers, “We will go too. We will die there with Jesus.” Jesus in Bethany "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,17 Jesus arrived in Bethany and found that Lazarus had already been dead and in the tomb for four days. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,18 Bethany was about two miles† from Jerusalem. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,19 Many Jews had come to see Martha and Mary. They came to comfort them about their brother Lazarus. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"20 When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to greet him. But Mary stayed home. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"21 Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,22 But I know that even now God will give you anything you ask.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"23 Jesus said, “Your brother will rise and be alive again.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"24 Martha answered, “I know that he will rise to live again at the time of the resurrection on the last day.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"25 Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection. I am life. Everyone who believes in me will have life, even if they die. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"26 And everyone who lives and believes in me will never really die. Martha, do you believe this?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"27 Martha answered, “Yes, Lord. I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God. You are the one who was coming to the world.” Jesus Cries "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"28 After Martha said these things, she went back to her sister Mary. She talked to Mary alone and said, “The Teacher is here. He is asking for you.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"29 When Mary heard this, she stood up and went quickly to Jesus. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,30 He had not yet come into the village. He was still at the place where Martha met him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,31 The Jews who were in the house comforting Mary saw her get up and leave quickly. They thought she was going to the tomb to cry there. So they followed her. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"32 Mary went to the place where Jesus was. When she saw him, she bowed at his feet and said, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"33 When Jesus saw Mary crying and the people with her crying too, he was very upset and deeply troubled. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"34 He asked, “Where did you put him?” They said, “Lord, come and see.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,35 Jesus cried. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"36 And the Jews said, “Look! He loved Lazarus very much!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"37 But some of them said, “Jesus healed the eyes of the blind man. Why didn’t he help Lazarus and stop him from dying?” Jesus Raises Lazarus From Death *"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"38 Again feeling very upset, Jesus came to the tomb. It was a cave with a large stone covering the entrance. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"39 He said, “Move the stone away.” Martha said, “But, Lord, it has been four days since Lazarus died. There will be a bad smell.” Martha was the sister of the dead man. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"40 Then Jesus said to her, “Remember what I told you? I said that if you believed, you would see God’s divine greatness.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"41 So they moved the stone away from the entrance. Then Jesus looked up and said, “Father, I thank you that you heard me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,42 I know that you always hear me. But I said these things because of the people here around me. I want them to believe that you sent me.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"43 After Jesus said this he called in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"44 The dead man came out. His hands and feet were wrapped with pieces of cloth. He had a handkerchief covering his face. Jesus said to the people, “Take off the cloth and let him go.” The Jewish Leaders Plan to Kill Jesus (Matthew poured the perfume on Jesus’ feet. Then she wiped his feet with her hair. Andthe sweet smell from the perfume filled the whole house."
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"4 Judas Iscariot, one of Jesus’ followers, was there—the one who would later hand Jesus over to his enemies. Judas said, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"5 “That perfume was worth a full year’s pay.† It should have been sold, and the money should have been given to the poor people.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,6 But Judas did not really care about the poor. He said this because he was a thief. He was the one who kept the moneybag for the group of followers. And he often stole money from the bag. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"7 Jesus answered, “Don’t stop her. It was right for her to save this perfume for today—the day for me to be prepared for burial. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,8 You will always have those who are poor with you.‡ But you will not always have me.” The Plot Against Lazarus 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"9 Many of the Jews heard that Jesus was in Bethany, so they went there to see him. They also went there to see Lazarus, the one Jesus raised from death. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,10 So the leading priests made plans to kill Lazarus too. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"11 Because of him, many Jews were leaving them and believing in Jesus. That is why they wanted to kill Lazarus too. Jesus Enters Jerusalem Like a King (Matthew"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,20 There were some Greeks there too. These were some of the people who went to Jerusalem to worship at the Passover festival. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"21 They went to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee. They said, “Sir, we want to meet Jesus.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,22 Philip went and told Andrew. Then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"23 Jesus said to them, “The time has come for the Son of Man to receive his glory. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"24 It is a fact that a grain of wheat must fall to the ground and die before it can grow and produce much more wheat. If it never dies, it will never be more than a single seed. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,25 Whoever loves the life they have now will lose it. But whoever is willing to give up their life in this world will keep it. They will have eternal life. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,26 Whoever serves me must follow me. My servants must be with me everywhere I am. My Father will give honor to anyone who serves me. Jesus Talks About His Death 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"27 “Now I am very troubled. What should I say? Should I say, ‘Father save me from this time of suffering’? No, I came to this time so that I could suffer. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"28 Father, do what will bring you glory!” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have already brought glory to myself. I will do it again.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"29 The people standing there heard the voice. They said it was thunder. But others said, “An angel spoke to him!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"30 Jesus said, “That voice was for you and not for me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,31 Now is the time for the world to be judged. Now the ruler of this world will be thrown out. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"32 I will be lifted up† from the earth. When that happens, I will draw all people to myself.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,33 Jesus said this to show how he would die. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"34 The people said, “But our law says that the Messiah will live forever. So why do you say, ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up’? Who is this ‘Son of Man’?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"35 Then Jesus said, “The light‡ will be with you for only a short time more. So walk while you have the light. Then the darkness will not catch you. People who walk in the darkness don’t know where they are going. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"36 So put your trust in the light while you still have it. Then you will be children of light.” When Jesus finished saying these things, he went away to a place where the people could not find him. Some Jews Refuse to Believe in Jesus "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"37 The people saw all these miraculous signs Jesus did, but they still did not believe in him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"38 This was to give full meaning to what Isaiah the prophet said “Lord, who believed what we told them? Who has seen the Lord’s power?” Isaiah"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,41 Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus’ divine greatness. So he spoke about him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"42 But many people believed in Jesus. Even many of the Jewish leaders believed in him, but they were afraid of the Pharisees, so they did not say openly that they believed. They were afraid they would be ordered to stay out of the synagogue. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,43 They loved praise from people more than praise from God. Jesus’ Teaching Will Judge People 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,"44 Then Jesus said loudly, “Everyone who believes in me is really believing in the one who sent me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,45 Everyone who sees me is really seeing the one who sent me. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,46 I came into this world as a light. I came so that everyone who believes in me will not stay in darkness. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,47 “I did not come into the world to judge people. I came to save the people in the world. So I am not the one who judges those who hear my teaching and do not obey. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,48 But there is a judge for all those who refuse to believe in me and do not accept what I say. The message I have spoken will judge them on the last day. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,49 That is because what I taught was not from myself. The Father who sent me told me what to say and what to teach. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,50 And I know that whatever he says to do will bring eternal life. So the things I say are exactly what the Father told me to say.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,8,13 Jesus Washes His Followers’ Feet 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,9,1 It was almost time for the Jewish Passover festival. Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go back to the Father. Jesus had always loved the people in the world who were his. Now was the time he showed them his love the most. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,9,2 Jesus and his followers were at the evening meal. The devil had already persuaded Judas Iscariot to hand Jesus over to his enemies. (Judas was the son of Simon.) 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,9,3 The Father had given Jesus power over everything. Jesus knew this. He also knew that he had come from God. And he knew that he was going back to God. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,9,"4 So while they were eating, Jesus stood up and took off his robe. He got a towel and wrapped it around his waist. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,9,5 Then he poured water into a bowl and began to wash the followers’ feet.* He dried their feet with the towel that was wrapped around his waist. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,9,"6 He came to Simon Peter. But Peter said to him, “Lord, you should not wash my feet.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,9,"7 Jesus answered, “You don’t know what I am doing now. But later you will understand.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,9,"8 Peter said, “No! You will never wash my feet.” Jesus answered, “If I don’t wash your feet, you are not one of my people.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,9,"9 Simon Peter said, “Lord, after you wash my feet, wash my hands and my head too!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,9,"10 Jesus said, “After a person has a bath, his whole body is clean. He needs only to wash his feet. And you are clean, but not all of you.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,9,"11 Jesus knew who would hand him over to his enemies. That is why he said, “Not all of you are clean.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,9,"12 When Jesus finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and went back to the table. He asked, “Do you understand what I did for you? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,9,"13 You call me ‘Teacher.’ And you call me ‘Lord.’ And this is right, because that is what I am. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,9,14 I * am your Lord and Teacher. But I washed your feet. So you also should wash eachother’s feet. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,9,15 I did this as an example for you. So you should serve each other just as I served you. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,9,"16 Believe me, servants are not greater than their master. Those who are sent to do something are not greater than the one who sent them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,9,"17 If you know these things, great blessings will be yours if you do them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,9,18 “I am not talking about all of you. I know the people I have chosen. But what the Scriptures say must happen ‘The man who shared my food has turned against me.’† 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,9,"19 I am telling you this now before it happens. Then when it happens, you will believe that I AM.‡ "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,9,14 Jesus Comforts His Followers 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,10,"1 Jesus said, “Don’t be troubled. Trust in God, and trust in me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,10,2 There are many rooms in my Father’s house. I would not tell you this if it were not true. I am going there to prepare a place for you.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,10,4 You know the way to the place where I am going.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,10,"5 Thomas said, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,10,"6 Jesus answered, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. The only way to the Father is through me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,10,"7 If you really knew me, you would know my Father too. But now you know the Father. You have seen him.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,10,"8 Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father. That is all we need.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,10,"9 Jesus answered, “Philip, I have been with you for a long time. So you should know me. Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father too. So why do you say, ‘Show us the Father’? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,10,"10 Don’t you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The things I have told you don’t come from me. The Father lives in me, and he is doing his own work. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,10,11 Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me. Or believe because of the miracles I have done. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,10,"12 “I can assure you that whoever believes in me will do the same things I have done. And they will do even greater things than I have done, because I am going to the Father. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,10,20 On that day you will know that I am in the Father. You will know that you are in me and I am in you. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,10,"21 Those who really love me are the ones who not only know my commands but also obey them. My Father will love such people, and I will love them. I will make myself known to them.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,10,"22 Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, “Lord, how will you make yourself known to us, but not to the world?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,10,"23 Jesus answered, “All who love me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them. My Father and I will come to them and live with them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,10,24 But anyone who does not love me does not obey my teaching. This teaching that you hear is not really mine. It is from my Father who sent me. *
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,10,25 “I have told you all these things while I am with you.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,10,"28 You heard me say to you, ‘I am leaving, but I will come back to you.’ If you loved me, you would be happy that I am going back to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,10,"29 I have told you this now, before it happens. Then when it happens, you will believe. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,10,30 “I will not talk with you much longer. The ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,11,"1 Jesus said, “I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,11,2 He cuts off every branch* of mine that does not produce fruit.† He also trims every branch that produces fruit to prepare it to produce even more. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,11,3 You have already been prepared to produce more fruit by the teaching I have given you. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,11,4 Stay joined to me and I will stay joined to you. No branch can produce fruit alone. It must stay connected to the vine. It is the same with you. You cannot produce fruit alone. You must stay joined to me. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,11,"5 “I am the vine, and you are the branches. If you stay joined to me, and I to you, you will produce plenty of fruit. But separated from me you won’t be able to do anything. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,11,"6 If you don’t stay joined to me, you will be like a branch that has been thrown out and has dried up. All the dead branches like that are gathered up, thrown into the fire and burned. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,11,"7 Stay joined together with me, and follow my teachings. If you do this, you can ask for anything you want, and it will be given to you. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,11,11 I have told you these things so that you can have the true happiness that I have. I want you to be completely happy. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,11,12 This is what I command you Love each other as I have loved you. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,11,13 The greatest love people can show is to die for their friends.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,11,"15 I no longer call you servants, because servants don’t know what their master is doing. But now I call you friends, because I have told you everything that my Father told me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,11,16 “You did not choose me. I chose you. And I gave you this work to go and produce fruit—fruit that will last. Then the Father will give you anything you ask for in my name.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,11,"19 If you belonged to the world, the world would love you as it loves its own people. But I have * chosen you to be different from those in the world. So you don’t belong to theworld, and that is why the world hates you."
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,11,"20 “Remember the lesson I told you Servants are not greater than their master. If people treated me badly, they will treat you badly too. And if they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours too. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,11,"22 If I had not come and spoken to the people of the world, they would not be guilty of sin. But now I have spoken to them. So they have no excuse for their sin. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,11,23 “Whoever hates me also hates my Father. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,11,"24 I did things among the people of the world that no one else has ever done. If I had not done those things, they would not be guilty of sin. But they have seen what I did, and still they hate me and my Father. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,12,"2 People will tell you to leave their synagogues and never come back. In fact, the time will come when they will think that killing you would be doing service for God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,12,"3 They will do this because they have not known the Father, and they have not known me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,12,"4 I have told you all this now to prepare you. So when the time comes for these things to happen, you will remember that I warned you. The Work of the Holy Spirit “I did not tell you these things at the beginning, because I was with you then. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,12,6 But you are filled with sadness because I have told you all this. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,12,"7 Let me assure you, it is better for you that I go away. I say this because when I go away I will send the Helper to you. But if I did not go, the Helper would not come. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,12,"18 They also asked, “What does he mean by ‘a short time’? We don’t understand what he is saying.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,12,"19 Jesus saw that the followers wanted to ask him about this. So he said to them, “Are you asking each other what I meant when I said, ‘After a short time you won’t see me. Then after another short time you will see me again’? "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,13,"7 The Jewish leaders answered, “We have a law that says he must die, because he said he is the Son of God.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,13,"8 When Pilate heard this, he was more afraid. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,13,"9 So he went back inside the palace and asked Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus did not answer him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,13,"10 Pilate said, “You refuse to speak to me? Remember, I have the power to make you free or to kill you on a cross.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,13,"11 Jesus answered, “The only power you have over me is the power given to you by God. So the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,13,"12 After this, Pilate tried to let Jesus go free. But the Jewish leaders shouted, “Anyone who makes himself a king is against Caesar. So if you let this man go free, that means you are not Caesar’s friend.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,13,"13 When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out to the place called “The Stone Pavement.” (In Aramaic the name is Gabbatha.) Pilate sat down on the judge’s seat there. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,13,"5 He bent down and looked in. He saw the pieces of linen cloth lying there, but he did not go in. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,13,7 He also saw the cloth that had been around Jesus’ head. It was folded up and laid in a different place from the pieces of linen.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,13,"29 Jesus said to him, “You believe because you see me. Great blessings belong to the people who believe without seeing me!” Why John Wrote This Book "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,13,"30 Jesus did many other miraculous signs that his followers saw, which are not written in this book. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,"1 Later, Jesus appeared again to his followers by Lake Galilee.* This is how it happened "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,"2 Some of the followers were together—Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the two sons of Zebedee, and two other followers. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,"3 Simon Peter said, “I am going out to fish.” The other followers said, “We will go with you.” So all of them went out and got into the boat. They fished that night but caught nothing. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,4 Early the next morning Jesus stood on the shore. But the followers did not know it was Jesus. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,"5 Then he said to them, “Friends, have you caught any fish?” They answered, “No.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,"6 He said, “Throw your net into the water on the right side of your boat. You will find some fish there.” So they did this. They caught so many fish that they could not pull the net back into the boat. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,"7 The follower Jesus loved very much said to Peter, “That man is the Lord!” When Peter heard him say it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat around himself. (He had taken his clothes off to work.) Then he jumped into the water. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,"8 The other followers went to shore in the boat. They pulled the net full of fish. They were not very far from shore, only about "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,"9 When they stepped out of the boat and onto the shore, they saw a fire of hot coals. There were fish on the fire and some bread there too. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,"10 Then Jesus said, “Bring some of the fish that you caught.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,11 Simon Peter got into the boat and pulled the net to the shore. It was full of big fish—
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,"153 of them! But even with that many fish, the net did not tear. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,"12 Jesus said to them, “Come and eat.” None of the followers would ask him, “Who are you?” They knew he was the Lord. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,13 Jesus walked over to get the bread and gave it to them. He also gave them the fish. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,14 This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his followers after he was raised from death. Jesus Talks to Peter 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,"15 When they finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these other men love me?” Peter answered, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” Then Jesus said to him, “Take care of my lambs.‡” *"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,"16 Again Jesus said to him, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” Peter answered, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” Then Jesus said, “Take care of my sheep.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,"17 A third time Jesus said, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” Peter was sad because Jesus asked him three times, “Do you love me?” He said, “Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you!” Jesus said to him, “Take care of my sheep. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,"18 The truth is, when you were young, you tied your own belt and went where you wanted. But when you are old, you will put out your hands, and someone else will tie your belt. They will lead you where you don’t want to go.” 19 (Jesus said this to show how Peter would die to give glory to God.) Then he said to Peter, “Follow me!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,"19 (Jesus said this to show how Peter would die to give glory to God.) Then he said to Peter, “Follow me!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,"20 Peter turned and saw the follower Jesus loved very much walking behind them. (This was the follower who had leaned against Jesus at the supper and said, “Lord, who is it that will hand you over?”) "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,"21 When Peter saw him behind them, he asked Jesus, “Lord, what about him?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,"22 Jesus answered, “Maybe I want him to live until I come. That should not matter to you. You follow me!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,"23 So a story spread among the followers of Jesus. They were saying that this follower would not die. But Jesus did not say he would not die. He only said, “Maybe I want him to live until I come. That should not matter to you.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,24 That follower is the one who is telling these things. He is the one who has now written them all down. We know that what he says is true. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,John,14,"25 There are many other things that Jesus did. If every one of them were written down, I think the whole world would not be big enough for all the books that would be written."

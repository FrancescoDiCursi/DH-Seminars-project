Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,1 Most Honorable Theophilus Many others have tried to give a report of the things that happened among us to complete God’s plan. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,2 What they have written agrees with what we learned from the people who saw those events from the beginning. They also served God by telling people his message. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,3 I studied it all carefully from the beginning. Then I decided to write it down for you in an organized way. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,4 I did this so that you can be sure that what you have been taught is true. Zechariah and Elizabeth 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"5 During the time when Herod ruled Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah. He belonged to Abijah’s group.* His wife came from the family of Aaron. Her name was Elizabeth. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"6 Zechariah and Elizabeth were both good people who pleased God. They did everything the Lord commanded, always following his instructions completely. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"7 But they had no children. Elizabeth could not have a baby, and both of them were very old. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,8 Zechariah was serving as a priest before God for his group. It was his group’s time to serve. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"9 The priests always chose one priest to offer the incense, and Zechariah was the one chosen this time. So he went into the Temple of the Lord to offer the incense. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,10 There was a large crowd outside praying at the time the incense was offered. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"11 Then, on the right side of the incense table, an angel of the Lord came and stood before Zechariah. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"12 When he saw the angel, Zechariah was upset and very afraid. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"13 But the angel said to him, “Zechariah, don’t be afraid. Your prayer has been heard by God. Your wife Elizabeth will give birth to a baby boy, and you will name him John. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"14 You will be very happy, and many others will share your joy over his birth. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"15 He will be a great man for the Lord. He will never drink wine or beer. Even before he is born, he will be filled with the Holy Spirit. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,16 “John will help many people of Israel return to the Lord their God. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,17 John himself will go ahead of the Lord and make people ready for his coming. He will be powerful like Elijah and will have the same spirit. He will make peace between fathers and their children. He will cause people who are not obeying God to change and start thinking the way they should.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"18 Zechariah said to the angel, “How can I know that what you say is true? I am an old man, and my wife is also old.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"19 The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel, the one who always stands ready before God. He sent me to talk to you and to tell you this good news. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"20 Now, listen! You will not be able to talk until the day when these things happen. You will lose your speech because you did not believe what I told you. But everything I said will really happen.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"21 Outside, the people were still waiting for Zechariah. They were surprised that he was staying so long in the Temple. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"22 Then Zechariah came outside, but he could not speak to them. So the people knew that he had seen a vision inside the Temple. He was not able to speak, so he could only make signs to the people. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"23 When his time of service was finished, he went home. *"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"24 Later, Zechariah’s wife Elizabeth became pregnant. So she did not go out of her house for five months. She said, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,25 “Look what the Lord has done for me! He decided to help me. Now people will stop thinking there is something wrong with me.” The Virgin Mary 26-

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"28 The angel came to her and said, “Greetings! The Lord is with you; you are very special to him.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"29 But Mary was very confused about what the angel said. She wondered, “What does this mean?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"30 The angel said to her, “Don’t be afraid, Mary, because God is very pleased with you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,31 Listen! You will become pregnant and have a baby boy. You will name him Jesus. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"32 He will be great. People will call him the Son of the Most High God, and the Lord God will make him king like his ancestor David. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,33 He will rule over the people of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"34 Mary said to the angel, “How will this happen? I am still a virgin.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"35 The angel said to Mary, “The Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of the Most High God will cover you. The baby will be holy and will be called the Son of God. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,37 God can do anything!”

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"41 When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the unborn baby inside her jumped, and she was filled with the Holy Spirit. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"42 In a loud voice she said to Mary, “God has blessed you more than any other woman. And God has blessed the baby you will have. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"43 You are the mother of my Lord, and you have come to me! Why has something so good happened to me? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"44 When I heard your voice, the baby inside me jumped with joy. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,45 Great blessings are yours because you believed what the Lord said to you! You believed this would happen.” Mary Praises God 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"46 Then Mary said, “I praise the Lord with all my heart. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,47 I am very happy because God is my Savior. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"48 I am not important, but he has shown his care for me, his lowly servant. From now until the end of time, people will remember how much God blessed me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"49 Yes, the Powerful One has done great things for me. His name is very holy. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,50 He always gives mercy to those who worship him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,51 He reached out his arm and showed his power. He scattered those who are proud and think great things about themselves.
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,52 He brought down rulers from their thrones and raised up the humble people. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"53 He filled the hungry with good things, but he sent the rich away with nothing. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,54 God has helped Israel—the people he chose to serve him. He did not forget his promise to give us his mercy. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"55 He has done what he promised to our ancestors, to Abraham and his children forever.” "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"59 When the baby was eight days old, they came to circumcise him. They wanted to name him Zechariah because this was his father’s name. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"60 But his mother said, “No, he will be named John.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"61 The people said to Elizabeth, “But no one in your family has that name.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"62 Then they made signs to his father, “What would you like to name him?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"63 Zechariah asked for something to write on. Then he wrote, “His name is John.” Everyone was surprised. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"64 Then Zechariah could talk again, and he began praising God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"65 And all their neighbors were afraid. In all the hill country of Judea, people continued talking about these things. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"66 Everyone who heard about these things wondered about them. They thought, “What will this child be?” They could see that the Lord was with him. Zechariah Praises God "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"67 Then Zechariah, John’s father, was filled with the Holy Spirit and told the people a message from God "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,68 “Praise to the Lord God of Israel. He has come to help his people and has given them freedom. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,69 He has given us a powerful Savior from the family of his servant David. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,70 This is what he promised through his holy prophets long ago. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,71 He will save us from our enemies and from the power of all those who hate us. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"72 God said he would show mercy to our fathers, and he remembered his holy agreement. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"73 This was the promise he made to our father Abraham, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"74 a promise to free us from the power of our enemies, so that we could serve him without fear "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,75 in a way that is holy and right for as long as we live. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"76 “Now you, little boy, will be called a prophet of the Most High God. You will go first before the Lord to prepare the way for him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,77 You will make his people understand that they will be saved by having their sins forgiven.
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"78 “With the loving mercy of our God, a new day† from heaven will shine on us. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,"79 It will bring light to those who live in darkness, in the fear of death. It will guide us into the way that brings peace.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Luke,1,80 And so the little boy John grew up and became stronger in spirit. Then he lived in areas away from other people until the time when he came out to tell God’s message to the people of Israel.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans, Romans,
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,"1 Greetings from Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus. God chose me to be an apostle and gave me the work of telling his Good News. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,2 God promised long ago through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures to give this Good News to his people. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,"3-4 The Good News is about God’s Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. As a human, he was born from the family of David, but through the Holy Spirit* he was shown to be God’s powerful Son when he was raised from death. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,"5 Through Christ, God gave me the special work of an apostle—to lead people of all nations to believe and obey him. I do all this to honor Christ. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,6 You are some of those who have been chosen to belong to Jesus Christ. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,"7 This letter is to all of you in Rome. God loves you, and he has chosen you to be his holy people. Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. A Prayer of Thanks "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,8 First I want to say that I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you. I thank him because people everywhere in the world are talking about your great faith. 9-
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,"10 Every time I pray, I always remember you. God knows this is true. He is the one I serve with all my heart by telling people the Good News about his Son. I pray that I will be allowed to come to you. It will happen if God wants it. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,11 I want very much to see you and give you some spiritual gift to make your faith stronger. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,"12 I mean that I want us to help each other with the faith that we have. Your faith will help me, and my faith will help you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,"13 Brothers and sisters, I want you to know that I have planned many times to come to you, but something always happens to change my plans. I would like to see the same good result among you that I have had from my work among the other non-Jewish people. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,"14 I must serve all people—those who share in Greek culture and those who are less civilized,† the educated as well as the ignorant. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,15 That is why I want so much to tell the Good News to you there in Rome. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,"16 I am proud of the Good News, because it is the power God uses to save everyone who believes—to save the Jews first, and now to save those who are not Jews. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,"17 The Good News shows how God makes people right with himself. God’s way of making people right begins and ends with faith. As the Scriptures say, “The one who is right with God by faith will live forever.”✡ All People Have Done Wrong "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,18 God shows his anger from heaven against all the evil and wrong things that people do. Their evil lives hide the truth they have. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,"19 This makes God angry because they have been shown what he is like. Yes, God has made it clear to them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,"20 There are things about God that people cannot see—his eternal power and all that makes him God. But since the beginning of the world, those things have been easy for people to understand. They are made clear in what God has made. So people have no excuse for the evil they do. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,"21 People knew God, but they did not honor him as God, and they did not thank him. Their ideas were all useless. There was not one good thought left in their * foolish minds. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,"22 They said they were wise, but they became fools. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,"23 Instead of honoring the divine greatness of God, who lives forever, they traded it for the worship of idols—things made to look like humans, who get sick and die, or like birds, animals, and snakes. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,24 People wanted only to do evil. So God left them and let them go their sinful way. And so they became completely immoral and used their bodies in shameful ways with each other. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,25 They traded the truth of God for a lie. They bowed down and worshiped the things God made instead of worshiping the God who made those things. He is the one who should be praised forever. Amen. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,"26 Because people did those things, God left them and let them do the shameful things they wanted to do. Women stopped having natural sex with men and started having sex with other women. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,"27 In the same way, men stopped having natural sex with women and began wanting each other all the time. Men did shameful things with other men, and in their bodies they received the punishment for those wrongs. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,28 People did not think it was important to have a true knowledge of God. So God left them and allowed them to have their own worthless thinking. And so they do what they should not do. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,"29 They are filled with every kind of sin, evil, greed, and hatred. They are full of jealousy, murder, fighting, lying, and thinking the worst things about each other. They gossip "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,"30 and say evil things about each other. They hate God. They are rude, proud, and brag about themselves. They invent ways of doing evil. They don’t obey their parents, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,"31 they are foolish, they don’t keep their promises, and they show no kindness or mercy to others. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,"32 They know God’s law says that anyone who lives like that should die. But they not only continue to do these things themselves, but they also encourage others who do them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,1,2 Let God Be the Judge 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,"1 So do you think that you can judge those other people? You are wrong. You too are guilty of sin. You judge them, but you do the same things they do. So when you judge them, you are really condemning yourself. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,"2 God judges all who do such things, and we know his judgment is right. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,"3 And since you do the same things as those people you judge, surely you understand that God will punish you too. How could you think you would be able to escape his judgment? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,"4 God has been kind to you. He has been very patient, waiting for you to change. But you think nothing of his kindness. Maybe you don’t understand that God is kind to you so that you will decide to change your lives. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,5 But you are so stubborn! You refuse to change. So you are making your own punishment greater and greater. You will be punished on the day when God will show his anger. On that day everyone will see how right God is to judge people. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,6 He will reward or punish everyone for what they have done. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,"7 Some people live for God’s glory, for honor, and for life that cannot be destroyed. They live for those things by always continuing to do good. God will give eternal life to them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,8 But others are selfish and refuse to follow truth. They follow evil. God will show his anger and punish them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,9 He will give trouble and suffering to everyone who does evil—to the Jews first and also to those who are not Jews. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,"10 But he will give glory, honor, and peace to everyone who does good—to the Jews first and also to those who are not Jews. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,11 God judges everyone the same. It doesn’t matter who they are.
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,"12 People who have the law and those who have never heard of the law are all the same when they sin. People who don’t have the law and are sinners will be lost. And, in the same way, those who have the law and are sinners will be judged by the law. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,13 Hearing the law does not make people right with God. They will be right before him only if they always do what the law says. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,"14 Those who are not Jews don’t have the law. But when they naturally do what the law commands without even knowing the law, then they are their own law. This is true even though they don’t have the written law. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,"15 They show that in their hearts they know what is right and wrong, the same as the law commands, and their consciences agree. Sometimes their thoughts tell them that they have done wrong, and this makes them guilty. And sometimes their thoughts tell them that they have done right, and this makes them not guilty. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,16 All this will happen on the day when God will judge people’s secret thoughts through Jesus Christ. This is part of the Good News that I tell everyone. The Jews and the Law 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,17 What about you? You say you are a Jew. You trust in the law and proudly claim to be close to God. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,"18 You know what God wants you to do. And you know what is important, because you have learned the law. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,"19 You think you are a guide for people who don’t know the right way, a light for those who are in the dark. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,"20 You think you can show foolish people what is right. And you think you are a teacher for those who are just beginning to learn. You have the law, and so you think you know everything and have all truth. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,"21 You teach others, so why don’t you teach yourself? You tell them not to steal, but you yourself steal. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,"22 You say they must not commit adultery, but you yourself are guilty of that sin. You hate idols, but you steal them from their temples. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,"23 You are so proud that you have God’s law, but you bring shame to God by breaking his law. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,"24 As the Scriptures say, “People in other nations insult God because of you.”✡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,"25 If you follow the law, then your circumcision has meaning. But if you break the law, then it is as if you were never circumcised. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,"26 Those who are not Jews are not circumcised. But if they do what the law says, it is as if they were circumcised. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,"27 You have the written law and circumcision, but you break the law. So those who are not circumcised in their bodies, but still obey the law, will show that you are guilty. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,28 You are not a true Jew if you are only a Jew in your physical body. True circumcision is not only on the outside of the body. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,2,"29 A true Jew is one who is a Jew inside. True circumcision is done in the heart. It is done by the Spirit, not by the written law. And anyone who is circumcised in the heart by the Spirit gets praise from God, not from people. 3 "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,3,"1 So, do Jews have anything that others don’t have? Do they get any benefit from being circumcised? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,3,"2 Yes, the Jews have many benefits. The most important one is this God trusted the Jews with his teachings. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,3,3 It is true that some Jews were not faithful to God. But will that stop God from doing what he promised? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,3,"4 No, even if everyone else is a liar, God will always do what he says. As the Scriptures say about him, “You will be proved right in what you say, and you will win when people accuse you.” Psalm"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,3,"5 When we do wrong, that shows more clearly that God is right. So can we say that God does wrong when he punishes us? (That’s the way some people think.) "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,3,"6 Of course not. If God could not punish us, how could he judge the world? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,3,"7 Someone might say, “When I lie, it really gives God glory, because my lie makes his truth easier to see. So why am I judged a sinner?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,3,"8 It would be the same to say, “We should do evil so that good will come.” Many people criticize us, saying that’s what we teach. They are wrong, and they should be condemned for saying that. All People Are Guilty "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,3,"9 So are we Jews better than other people? No, we have already said that those who are Jews, as well as those who are not Jews, are the same. They are all guilty of sin. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,3,"10 As the Scriptures say, “There is no one doing what is right, not even one. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,3,11 There is no one who understands. There is no one who is trying to be with God. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,3,"12 They have all turned away from him, and now they are of no use to anyone. There is no one who does good, not even one.” Psalm what is right and fair. He was right in the past when he was patient and did notpunish people for their sins. And in our own time he still does what is right. Godworked all this out in a way that allows him to judge people fairly and still makeright any person who has faith in Jesus."
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,3,"27 So do we have any reason to boast about ourselves? No reason at all. And why not? Because we are depending on the way of faith, not on what we have done in following the law. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,3,"28 I mean we are made right with God through faith, not through what we have done to follow the law. This is what we believe. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,3,29 God is not only the God of the Jews. He is also the God of those who are not Jews. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,3,"30 There is only one God. He will make Jews† right with him by their faith, and he will also make non-Jews‡ right with him through their faith. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,3,"31 So do we destroy the law by following the way of faith? Not at all! In fact, faith causes us to be what the law actually wants. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,3,4 The Example of Abraham 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,4,"1 So what can we say about Abraham, the father of our people? What did he learn about faith? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,4,"2 If Abraham was made right by the things he did, he had a reason to boast about himself. But God knew different. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,4,"3 That’s why the Scriptures say, “Abraham believed God, and because of this he was accepted as one who is right with God.”✡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,4,"4 When people work, their pay is not given to them as a gift. They earn the pay they get. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,4,"5 But people cannot do any work that will make them right with God. So they must trust in him. Then he accepts their faith, and that makes them right with him. He is the one who makes even evil people right. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,4,6 David said the same thing when he was talking about the blessing people have when God accepts them as good without looking at what they have done 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,4,"7 “It is a great blessing when people are forgiven for the wrongs they have done, when their sins are erased! "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,4,8 It is a great blessing when the Lord accepts people as if they are without sin!” Psalm law. He received that promise because he was right with God through his faith.
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,4,"14 If people could get God’s promise by following the law, then faith is worthless. And God’s promise to Abraham is worthless, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,4,"15 because the law can only bring God’s anger on those who disobey it. But if there is no law, then there is nothing to disobey. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,4,"16 So people get what God promised by having faith. This happens so that the promise can be a free gift. And if the promise is a free gift, then all of Abraham’s people will get that promise. The promise is not just for those who live under the Law of Moses. It is for all who live with faith as Abraham did. He is the father of us all. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,4,"17 As the Scriptures say, “I have made you a father of many nations.”✡ This is true before God, the one Abraham believed—the God who gives life to the dead and speaks of things that don’t yet exist as if they are real. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,4,"18 There was no hope that Abraham would have children, but Abraham believed God and continued to hope. And that is why he became the father of many nations. As God told him, “You will have many descendants.”✡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,4,"19 Abraham was almost a hundred years old, so he was past the age for having children. Also, Sarah could not have children. Abraham was well aware of this, but his faith in God never became weak. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,4,"20 He never doubted that God would do what he promised. He never stopped believing. In fact, he grew stronger in his faith and just praised God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,4,21 Abraham felt sure that God was able to do what he promised. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,4,22 So that’s why “he was accepted as one who is right with God.”✡ 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,4,23 These words (“he was accepted”) were written not only for Abraham. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,4,24 They were also written for us. God will also accept us because we believe. We believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from death. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,4,"25 Jesus was handed over to die for our sins, and he was raised from death to make us right with God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,4,5 Right With God 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,5,1 We have been made right with God because of our faith. So we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,5,"2 Through our faith, Christ has brought us into that blessing of God’s grace that we now enjoy. And we are very happy because of the hope we have of sharing God’s glory. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,5,3 And we are also happy with the troubles we have. Why are we happy with troubles? Because we know that these troubles make us more patient. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,5,4 And this patience is proof that we are strong. And this proof gives us hope. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,5,5 And this hope will never disappoint us. We know this because God has poured out his love to fill our hearts through the Holy Spirit he gave us. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,5,"6 Christ died for us when we were unable to help ourselves. We were living against God, but at just the right time Christ died for us. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,5,"7 Very few people will die to save the life of someone else, even if it is for a good person. Someone might be willing to die for an especially good person. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,5,"8 But Christ died for us while we were still sinners, and by this God showed how much he loves us. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,5,9 We have been made right with God by the blood sacrifice of Christ. So through Christ we will surely be saved from God’s anger. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,5,"10 I mean that while we were God’s enemies, he made friends with us through his Son’s death. And the fact that we are now God’s friends makes it even more certain that he will save us through his Son’s life. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,5,"11 And not only will we be saved, but we also rejoice right now in what God has done for us through our Lord Jesus Christ. It is because of Jesus that we are now God’s friends. ✡ Adam and Christ"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,5,12 Sin came into the world because of what one man did. And with sin came death. So this is why all people must die—because all people have sinned. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,5,13 Sin was in the world before the Law of Moses. But God does not consider people guilty of sin if there is no law. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,5,"14 But from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, everyone had to die. Adam died because he sinned by not obeying God’s command. But even those who did not sin that same way had to die. That one man, Adam, can be compared to Christ, the one who was coming in the future. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,5,"15 But God’s free gift is not like Adam’s sin. Many people died because of the sin of that one man. But the grace that people received from God was much greater. Many received God’s gift of life by the grace of this other man, Jesus Christ. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,5,"16 After Adam sinned once, he was judged guilty. But the gift of God is different. His free gift came after many sins, and it makes people right with him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,5,"17 One man sinned, and so death ruled all people because of that one man. But now some people accept God’s full grace and his great gift of being made right. Surely they will have true life and rule through the one man, Jesus Christ. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,5,"18 So that one sin of Adam brought the punishment of death to all people. But in the same way, Christ did something so good that it makes all people right with God. And that brings them true life. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,5,"19 One man disobeyed God and many became sinners. But in the same way, one man obeyed God and many will be made right. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,5,"20 The law was brought in so that more people would sin the way Adam did. But where sin increased, there was even more of God’s grace. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,5,21 Sin once used death to rule us. But God gave us more of his grace so that grace could rule by making us right with him. And this brings us eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,5,6 Dead to Sin but Alive in Christ 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,1 So do you think we should continue sinning so that God will give us more and more grace? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,2 Of course not! Our old sinful life ended. It’s dead. So how can we continue living in sin? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,3 Did you forget that all of us became part of Christ Jesus when we were baptized? In our baptism we shared in his death. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,"4 So when we were baptized, we were buried with Christ and took part in his death. And just as Christ was raised from death by the wonderful power of the Father, so we can now live a new life. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,"5 Christ died, and we have been joined with him by dying too. So we will also be joined with him by rising from death as he did. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,6 We know that our old life was put to death on the cross with Christ. This happened so that our sinful selves would have no power over us. Then we would not be slaves to sin. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,7 Anyone who has died is made free from sin’s control. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,"8 If we died with Christ, we know that we will also live with him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,9 Christ was raised from death. And we know that he cannot die again. Death has no power over him now. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,"10 Yes, when Christ died, he died to defeat the power of sin one time—enough for all time. He now has a new life, and his new life is with God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,"11 In the same way, you should see yourselves as being dead to the power of sin and alive for God through Christ Jesus. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,12 But don’t let sin control your life here on earth. You must not be ruled by the things your sinful self makes you want to do. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,"13 Don’t offer the parts of your body to serve sin. Don’t use your bodies to do evil, but offer yourselves to God, as people who have died and now live. Offer the parts of your body to God to be used for doing good. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,"14 Sin will not be your master, because you are not under law. You now live under God’s grace. Slaves of Goodness"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,15 So what should we do? Should we sin because we are under grace and not under law? Certainly not! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,"16 Surely you know that you become the slaves of whatever you give yourselves to. Anything or anyone you follow will be your master. You can follow sin, or you can obey God. Following sin brings spiritual death, but obeying God makes you right with him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,"17 In the past you were slaves to sin—sin controlled you. But thank God, you fully obeyed what you were taught. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,"18 You were made free from sin, and now you are slaves to what is right. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,"19 I use this example from everyday life because you need help in understanding spiritual truths. In the past you offered the parts of your body to be slaves to your immoral and sinful thoughts. The result was that you lived only for sin. In the same way, you must now offer yourselves to be slaves to what is right. Then you will live only for God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,"20 In the past you were slaves to sin, and you did not even think about doing right. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,"21 You did evil things, and now you are ashamed of what you did. Did those things help you? No, they only brought death. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,"22 But now you are free from sin. You have become slaves of God, and the result is that you live only for God. This will bring you eternal life. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,"23 When people sin, they earn what sin pays—death. But God gives his people a free gift—eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,6,7 An Example From Marriage 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,"1 Brothers and sisters, you all understand the Law of Moses. So surely you know that the law rules over people only while they are alive. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,"2 It’s like what the law says about marriage A woman must stay married to her husband as long as he is alive. But if her husband dies, she is made free from the law of marriage. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,"3 But if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, the law says she is guilty of adultery. But if her husband dies, she is made free from the law of marriage. So if she marries another man after her husband dies, she is not guilty of adultery. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,"4 In the same way, my brothers and sisters, your old selves died and you became free from the law through the body of Christ. Now you belong to someone else. You belong to the one who was raised from death. We belong to Christ so that we can be used in service to God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,"5 In the past we were ruled by our sinful selves. The law made us want to do sinful things. And those sinful desires controlled our bodies, so that what we did only brought us spiritual death. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,"6 In the past the law held us as prisoners, but our old selves died, and we were made free from the law. So now we serve God in a new way, not in the old way, with the written rules. Now we serve God in the new way, with the Spirit. Our Fight Against Sin "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,"7 You might think I am saying that sin and the law are the same. That is not true. But the law was the only way I could learn what sin means. I would never have known it is wrong to want something that is not mine. But the law said, “You must not want what belongs to someone else.”✡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,"8 And sin found a way to use that command and make me want all kinds of things that weren’t mine. So sin came to me because of the command. But without the law, sin has no power. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,"9 Before I knew the law, I was alive. But when I heard the law’s command, sin began to live, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,"10 and I died spiritually. The command was meant to bring life, but ✡ for me it brought death. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,11 Sin found a way to fool me by using the command to make me die. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,"12 Now the law is holy, and the command is holy and right and good. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,"13 Does this mean that something that is good brought death to me? No, it was sin that used the good command to bring me death. This shows how terrible sin really is. It can use a good command to produce a result that shows sin at its very worst. The War Inside Us "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,"14 We know that the law is spiritual, but I am not. I am so human. Sin rules me as if I were its slave. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,"15 I don’t understand why I act the way I do. I don’t do the good I want to do, and I do the evil I hate. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,"16 And if I don’t want to do what I do, that means I agree that the law is good. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,17 But I am not really the one doing the evil. It is sin living in me that does it. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,"18 Yes, I know that nothing good lives in me—I mean nothing good lives in the part of me that is not spiritual. I want to do what is good, but I don’t do it. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,19 I don’t do the good that I want to do. I do the evil that I don’t want to do. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,"20 So if I do what I don’t want to do, then I am not really the one doing it. It is the sin living in me that does it. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,"21 So I have learned this rule When I want to do good, evil is there with me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,22 In my mind I am happy with God’s law. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,"23 But I see another law working in my body. That law makes war against the law that my mind accepts. That other law working in my body is the law of sin, and that law makes me its prisoner. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,24 What a miserable person I am! Who will save me from this body that brings me death? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,"25 I thank God for his salvation through Jesus Christ our Lord! So in my mind I am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful self I am a slave to the law of sin. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,7,8 Life in the Spirit 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,1 So now anyone who is in Christ Jesus is not judged guilty. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,2 That is because in Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit that brings life made you* free. It made you free from the law that brings sin and death. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,3 The law was without power because it was made weak by our sinful selves. But God did what the law could not do He sent his own Son to earth with the same human life that everyone else uses for sin. God sent him to be an offering to pay for sin. So God used a human life to destroy sin. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,4 He did this so that we could be right just as the law said we must be. Now we don’t live following our sinful selves. We live following the Spirit. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,5 People who live following their sinful selves think only about what they want. But those who live following the Spirit are thinking about what the Spirit wants them to do. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"6 If your thinking is controlled by your sinful self, there is spiritual death. But if your thinking is controlled by the Spirit, there is life and peace. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,7 Why is this true? Because anyone whose thinking is controlled by their sinful self is against God. They refuse to obey God’s law. And really they are not able to obey it. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,8 Those who are ruled by their sinful selves cannot please God. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"9 But you are not ruled by your sinful selves. You are ruled by the Spirit, if that Spirit of God really lives in you. But whoever does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to Christ. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"10 Your body will always be dead because of sin. But if Christ is in you, then the Spirit gives you life, because Christ made you right with God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"11 God raised Jesus from death. And if God’s Spirit lives in you, he will also give life to your bodies that die. Yes, God is the one who raised Christ from death, and he will raise you to life through his Spirit living in you. *"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"12 So, my brothers and sisters, we must not be ruled by our sinful selves. We must not live the way our sinful selves want. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"13 If you use your lives to do what your sinful selves want, you will die spiritually. But if you use the Spirit’s help to stop doing the wrong things you do with your body, you will have true life. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,14 The true children of God are those who let God’s Spirit lead them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"15 The Spirit that we received is not a spirit that makes us slaves again and causes us to fear. The Spirit that we have makes us God’s chosen children. And with that Spirit we cry out, “Abba,† Father.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,16 And the Spirit himself speaks to our spirits and makes us sure that we are God’s children. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"17 If we are God’s children, we will get the blessings God has for his people. He will give us all that he has given Christ. But we must suffer like Christ suffered. Then we will be able to share his glory. We Will Have Glory in the Future "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"18 We have sufferings now, but these are nothing compared to the great glory that will be given to us. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,19 Everything that God made is waiting with excitement for the time when he will show the world who his children are. The whole world wants very much for that to happen. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"20 Everything God made was allowed to become like something that cannot fulfill its purpose. That was not its choice, but God made it happen with this hope in view "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,21 That the creation would be made free from ruin—that everything God made would have the same freedom and glory that belong to God’s children. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,22 We know that everything God made has been waiting until now in pain like a woman ready to give birth to a child. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"23 Not only the world, but we also have been waiting with pain inside us. We have the Spirit as the first part of God’s promise. So we are waiting for God to finish making us his own children. I mean we are waiting for our bodies to be made free. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"24 We were saved to have this hope. If we can see what we are waiting for, that is not really hope. People don’t hope for something they already have. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"25 But we are hoping for something we don’t have yet, and we are waiting for it patiently. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"26 Also, the Spirit helps us. We are very weak, but the Spirit helps us with our weakness. We don’t know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit himself speaks to God for us. He begs God for us, speaking to him with feelings too deep for words. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"27 God already knows our deepest thoughts. And he understands what the Spirit is saying, because the Spirit speaks for his people in the way that agrees with what God wants. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"28 We know that in everything God works for the good of those who love him. These are the people God chose, because that was his plan. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,29 God knew them before he made the world. And he decided that they would be like his Son. Then Jesus would be the firstborn of many brothers and sisters. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"30 God planned for them to be like his Son. He chose them and made them right with him. And after he made them right, he gave them his glory. God’s Love in Christ Jesus "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"31 So what should we say about this? If God is for us, no one can stand against us. And God is with us. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"32 He even let his own Son suffer for us. God gave his Son for all of us. So now with Jesus, God will surely give us all things. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,33 Who can accuse the people God has chosen? No one! God is the one who makes them right. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"34 Who can say that God’s people are guilty? No one! Christ Jesus died for us, but that is not all. He was also raised from death. And now he is at God’s right † side, speaking to him for us. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"35 Can anything separate us from Christ’s love? Can trouble or problems or persecution separate us from his love? If we have no food or clothes or face danger or even death, will that separate us from his love? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"36 As the Scriptures say, “For you we are in danger of death all the time. People think we are worth no more than sheep to be killed.” Psalm me. I wanted to show my power through you. I wanted my name to be announcedthroughout the world.”✡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,18 So God shows mercy to those he wants to show mercy to and makes stubborn those he wants to make stubborn. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"19 So one of you will ask me, “If God controls what we do, why does he blame us for our sins?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"20 Don’t ask that. You are only human and have no right to question God. A clay jar does not question the one who made it. It does not say, “Why did you make me like this?” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,21 The one who makes the jar can make anything he wants. He uses the same clay to make different things. He might make one thing for special purposes and another for daily use. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,22 It is the same way with what God has done. He wanted to show his anger and to let people see his power. But he patiently endured those he was angry with —people who were ready to be destroyed. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,23 He waited with patience so that he could make known the riches of his glory to the people he has chosen to receive his mercy. God has already prepared them to share his glory. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"24 We are those people, the ones God chose not only from the Jews but also from those who are not Jews. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"25 As the Scriptures say in the book of Hosea, “The people who are not mine— I will say they are my people. And the people I did not love— I will say they are the people I love.” Hosea “Look, I put in Zion a stone that will make people stumble.It is a rock that will make people fall.But anyone who trusts in himwill never be disappointed.” Isaiah"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"19 Again I ask, “Did the people of Israel not understand?” Yes, they did understand. First, Moses says this for God “I will use those who are not really a nation to make you jealous. I will use a nation that does not understand to make you angry.” Deuteronomy"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"11 So I ask When the Jews fell, did that fall destroy them? No! But their mistake brought salvation to those who are not Jews. The purpose of this was to make the Jews jealous. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,12 Their mistake brought rich blessings to the world. And what they lost brought rich blessings to the non-Jewish people. So surely the world will get much richer blessings when enough Jews become the kind of people God wants. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"13 Now I am speaking to you people who are not Jews. I am an apostle to the non-Jewish people. So while I have that work, I will do the best I can. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"14 I hope I can make my own people jealous. That way, maybe I can help some of them to be saved. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"15 God turned away from the Jews. When that happened, he became friends with the other people in the world. So when he accepts the Jews, it will be like bringing people to life after death. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"16 If the first piece of bread is offered to God, then the whole loaf is made holy. If the roots of a tree are holy, the tree’s branches are holy too. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"17 It is as if some of the branches from an olive tree have been broken off, and the branch of a wild olive tree has been joined to that first tree. If you are not a Jew, you are the same as that wild branch, and you now share the strength and life of the first tree. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"18 But don’t act as if you are better than those branches that were broken off. You have no reason to be proud of yourself, because you don’t give life to the root. The root gives life to you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"19 You might say, “Branches were broken off so that I could be joined to their tree.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"20 That is true. But those branches were broken off because they did not believe. And you continue to be part of the tree only because you believe. Don’t be proud, but be afraid. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"21 If God did not let the natural branches of that tree stay, he will not let you stay if you stop believing. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"22 So you see that God is kind, but he can also be very strict. He punishes those who stop following him. But he is kind to you, if you continue trusting in his kindness. If you don’t continue depending on him, you will be cut off from the tree. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"23 And if the Jews will believe in God again, he will accept them back. He is able to put them back where they were. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,24 It is not natural for a wild branch to become part of a good tree. But you non-Jewish people are like a branch cut from a wild olive tree. And you were joined to a good olive tree. But those Jews are like a branch that grew from the good tree. So surely they can be joined to their own tree again. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"25 I want you to understand this secret truth, brothers and sisters. This truth will help you understand that you don’t know everything. The truth is this Part of Israel has been made stubborn, but that will change when enough non- Jewish people have come to God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"26 And that is how all Israel will be saved. The Scriptures say, “The Savior will come from Zion; he will take away all evil from the family of Jacob. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"27 And I will make this agreement with those people when I take away their sins.” Isaiah now they are the ones who refuse to obey, because God showed mercy to you.But this happened so that they can also receive mercy from him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,32 All people have refused to obey God. And he has put them all together as people who don’t obey him so that he can show mercy to everyone. Praise to God 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"33 Yes, God’s riches are very great! His wisdom and knowledge have no end! No one can explain what God decides. No one can understand his ways. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"34 As the Scriptures say, “Who can know what is on the Lord’s mind? Who is able to give him advice?” Isaiah"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"14 Wish only good for those who treat you badly. Ask God to bless them, not curse them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"15 When others are happy, you should be happy with them. And when others are sad, you should be sad too. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"16 Live together in peace with each other. Don’t be proud, but be willing to be friends with people who are not important to others. Don’t think of yourself as smarter than everyone else. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"17 If someone does you wrong, don’t try to pay them back by hurting them. Try to do what everyone thinks is right. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,18 Do the best you can to live in peace with everyone. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"19 My friends, don’t try to punish anyone who does wrong to you. Wait for God to punish them with his anger. In the Scriptures the Lord says, “I am the one who punishes; I will pay people back.” Deuteronomy commands and all other commands are really only one rule “Love your neighbor*the same as you love yourself.”✡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,10 Love doesn’t hurt others. So loving is the same as obeying all the law. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"11 I say this because you know that we live in an important time. Yes, it is now time for you to wake up from your sleep. Our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,12 The night is almost finished. The day is almost here. So we should stop doing whatever belongs to darkness. We should prepare ourselves to fight evil with the weapons that belong to the light. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"13 We should live in a right way, like people who belong to the day. We should not have wild parties or be drunk. We should not be involved in sexual sin or any kind of immoral behavior. We should not cause arguments and trouble or be jealous. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,"14 But be like the Lord Jesus Christ, so that when people see what you do, they will see Christ. Don’t think about how to satisfy the desires of your sinful self. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,8,14 Don’t Criticize Others 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,9,1 Be willing to accept those who still have doubts about what believers can do. And don’t argue with them about their different ideas. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,9,"2 Some people believe they can eat any kind of food,* but those who have doubts eat only vegetables. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,9,3 Those who know they can eat any kind of food must not feel that they are better than those who eat only vegetables. And those who eat only vegetables must not decide that those who eat all foods are wrong. God has accepted them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,9,"4 You cannot judge the servants of someone else. Their own master decides if they are doing right or wrong. And the Lord’s servants will be right, because the Lord is able to make them right. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,9,5 Some people might believe that one day is more important than another. And others might believe that every day is the same. Everyone should be sure about their beliefs in their own mind. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,9,"6 Those who think one day is more important than other days are doing that for the Lord. And those who eat all kinds of food are doing that for the Lord. Yes, they give thanks to God for that food. And those who refuse to eat some foods do that for the Lord. They also give thanks to God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,9,7 We don’t live or die just for ourselves. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,9,"8 If we live, we are living for the Lord. And if we die, we are dying for the Lord. So living or dying, we belong to the Lord. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,9,9 That is why Christ died and rose from death to live again—so that he could be Lord over those who have died and those who are living. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,9,"10 So why do you judge your brother or sister in Christ? Or why do you think that you are better than they are? We will all stand before God, and he will judge us all. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,9,"11 Yes, the Scriptures say, “ ‘As surely as I live,’ says the Lord, ‘Everyone will bow before me; everyone will say that I am God.’ ” Isaiah"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,9,13 So we should stop judging each other. Let’s decide not to do anything that will cause a problem for a brother or sister or hurt their faith. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,9,"14 I know that there is no food that is wrong to eat. The Lord Jesus is the one who convinced me of that. But if someone believes that something is wrong, then it is wrong for that person. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,9,"15 If you hurt the faith of your brother or sister because of something you eat, you are not really following the way of love. Don’t destroy anyone’s faith by eating something they think is wrong. Christ died for them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,9,16 Don’t allow what is good for you to become something they say is evil. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,9,"17 In God’s kingdom, what we eat and drink is not important. Here is what is important a right way of life, peace, and joy—all from the Holy Spirit. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,9,"18 Whoever serves Christ by living this way is pleasing God, and they will be accepted by others. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,9,19 So let’s try as hard as we can to do what will bring peace. Let’s do whatever will help each other grow stronger in faith. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,9,"20 Don’t let the eating of food destroy the work of God. All food is right to eat, but it is wrong for anyone to eat something that hurts the faith of another person. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,9,21 It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else that hurts the faith of your brother or sister. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,9,22 You should keep your beliefs about these things a secret between yourself and God. It is a blessing to be able to do what you think is right without feeling guilty. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,9,"23 But anyone who eats something without being sure it is right is doing wrong. That is because they did not believe it was right. And if you do anything that you believe is not right, it is sin. 15 "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,10,1 Some of us have no problem with these things. So we should be patient with those who are not so strong and have doubts. We should not do what pleases us 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,10,2 but do what pleases them and is for their good. We should do whatever helps everyone grow stronger in faith. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,10,"3 Even Christ did not live trying to please himself. As the Scriptures say about him, “Those people who insulted you have also insulted me.”✡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,10,4 Everything that was written in the past was written to teach us. Those things were written so that we could have hope. That hope comes from the patience and encouragement that the Scriptures give us. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,10,"5 All patience and encouragement come from God. And I pray that God will help you all agree with each other, as Christ Jesus wants. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,10,6 Then you will all be joined together. And all together you will give glory to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,10,"7 Christ accepted you, so you should accept each other. This will bring honor* to God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,10,8 I tell you that Christ became a servant of the Jews to show that God has done what he promised their great ancestors. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,10,"9 Christ also did this so that the non-Jewish people could praise God for the mercy he gives to them. The Scriptures say, “So I will give thanks to you among the people of other nations; I will sing praise to your name.” Psalm “Praise the Lord all you people of other nations;all people should praise the Lord.” Psalm"

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,10,31 Pray that I will be saved from those in Judea who refuse to accept our message. And pray that this help I am bringing to Jerusalem will please God’s people there.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,10,16 Paul Has Some Final Things to Say 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,11,"1 I want you to know that you can trust our sister in Christ, Phoebe. She is a special servant of the church in Cenchrea. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,11,"2 I ask you to accept her in the Lord. Accept her the way God’s people should. Help her with anything she needs from you. She has helped me very much, and she has helped many others too. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,11,"3 Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila, who have worked together with me for Christ Jesus. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,11,"4 They risked their own lives to save mine. I am thankful to them, and all the non-Jewish churches are thankful to them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,11,"5 Also, give greetings to the church that meets in their house. Give greetings to my dear friend Epaenetus. He was the first person to follow Christ in Asia. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Romans,11,6 Greetings also to Mary. She worked very hard for you.

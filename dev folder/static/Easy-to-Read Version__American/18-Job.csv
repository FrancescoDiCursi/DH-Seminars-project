Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job," JobJob, the Good Man",
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,"1 There was a man named Job who lived in the country of Uz. He was a good, honest man. He respected God and refused to do evil. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,2 Job had seven sons and three daughters. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,3 He owned 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,"7000 sheep, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,"3000 camels, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,"1000 oxen, and "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,500 female donkeys. He had many servants. He was the richest man in the east. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,"4 Job’s sons took turns having dinner parties in their homes, and they invited their sisters. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,"5 The day after each of these parties, Job got up early in the morning, sent for his children, and offered a burnt offering for each of them. He thought, “Maybe my children were careless and sinned against God at their party.” Job always did this so that his children would be forgiven of their sins. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,6 Then the day came for the angels* to meet with the LORD. Even Satan was there with them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,"7 The LORD said to Satan, “Where have you been?” Satan answered the LORD, “I have been roaming around the earth, going from place to place.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,"8 Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you noticed my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him. He is a good, faithful man. He respects God and refuses to do evil.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,"9 Satan answered the LORD, “But Job has a good reason to respect you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,"10 You always protect him, his family, and everything he has. You have blessed him and made him successful in everything he does. He is so wealthy that his herds and flocks are all over the country. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,"11 But if you were to destroy everything he has, I promise you that he would curse you to your face.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,"12 The LORD said to Satan, “All right, do whatever you want with anything that he has, but don’t hurt Job himself.” Then Satan left the meeting. Job Loses Everything "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,13 One day Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine at the oldest brother’s house. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,"14 A messenger came to Job and said, “We were plowing the fields with the oxen and the donkeys were eating grass nearby, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,15 when some Sabeans† attacked us and took your animals! They killed the other servants. I am the only one who escaped to come and tell you the news!” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,"16 That messenger was still speaking when another one came in and said, “A bolt of lightning‡ struck your sheep and servants and burned them up. I am the only one who escaped to come and tell you the news!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,"17 That messenger was still speaking when another one came in and said, “The Chaldeans§ sent out three raiding parties that attacked us and took the camels! They killed the other servants. I am the only one who escaped to come and tell you the news!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,"18 That messenger was still speaking when another one came in and said, “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine at the oldest brother’s house. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,"19 A strong wind suddenly came in from across the desert and blew the house * down. It fell on your sons and daughters, and they are all dead. I am the onlyone who escaped to come and tell you the news!”"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,"20 When Job heard this, he got up, tore his clothes, and shaved his head to show his sadness. Then he fell to the ground to bow down before God "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,"21 and said, “When I was born into this world, I was naked and had nothing. When I die and leave this world, I will be naked and have nothing. The LORD gives, and the LORD takes away. Praise the name of the LORD!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,"22 Even after all this, Job did not sin. He did not accuse God of doing anything wrong. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,1,2 Satan Bothers Job Again 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,2,1 Then another day came for the angels* to meet with the LORD. Satan joined them for this meeting with the LORD. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,2,"2 The LORD said to Satan, “Where have you been?” Satan answered the LORD, “I have been roaming around the earth, going from place to place.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,2,"3 Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you noticed my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him. He is a good, faithful man. He respects God and refuses to do evil. He is still faithful, even though you asked me to let you destroy, without reason, everything he has.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,2,"4 Satan answered, “Skin for skin!† A man will give everything he has to protect himself. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,2,"5 I swear, if you attack his flesh and bones, he will curse you to your face!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,2,"6 So the LORD said to Satan, “All right, Job is in your hands, but you are not allowed to kill him.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,2,"7 So Satan left the meeting with the LORD and gave Job painful sores all over his body, from the bottom of his feet to the top of his head. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,2,8 Job sat on the pile of ashes where he was mourning and used a piece of broken pottery to scrape his sores. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,2,"9 His wife said to him, “Are you still holding on to your faith? Why don’t you just curse God and die!” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,2,"10 Job answered, “You sound like one of those fools on the street corner! How can we accept all the good things that God gives us and not accept the problems?” So even after all that happened to Job, he did not sin. He did not accuse God of doing anything wrong. Job’s Three Friends Come to See Him "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,2,"11 Job’s three friends heard about all the bad things that happened to him, so Eliphaz came from Teman, Bildad from Shuah, and Zophar from Naamah. They met together and went to comfort Job and show him their sympathy. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,2,12 But his friends didn’t even recognize him when they first saw him in the distance! They began to cry loudly. They tore their clothes and threw dirt in the air over their heads to show how sad they were. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,2,"13 Then they sat on the ground with Job for * seven days and seven nights. They didn’t say a word, because they saw he wasin so much pain."
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,2,3 Job Curses the Day He Was Born 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,1 Then Job opened his mouth and cursed the day he was born. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,"2 He said, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,"3 “I wish the day I was born would be lost forever. I wish the night they said, ‘It’s a boy!’ had never happened. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,4 I wish that day had remained dark. I wish God above had forgotten that day and not let any light shine on it. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,"5 I wish that bitter day had remained as dark as death, covered with the darkest clouds. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,"6 I wish the darkness had carried away that night, that it was left off the calendar and not included in any of the months. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,7 I wish that night had produced nothing and no happy shouts had been heard. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,8 Some magicians think they can wake Leviathan.* So let them say their curses and curse the day I was born. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,9 Let that day’s morning star be dark. Let that night wait for a morning that never comes. I wish it had never seen the first rays of sunlight. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,10 I wish it had stopped me from being born and kept me from seeing all these troubles. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,11 Why didn’t I die when I was born? Why didn’t I die as I came from my mother’s womb? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,12 Why did my mother hold me on her knees? Why did her breasts feed me? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,"13 If I had died when I was born, I would be at peace now. I wish I were asleep and at rest "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,14 with the kings and their advisors who built palaces that are now in ruins. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,15 I wish I were buried with rulers who filled their graves with gold and silver. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,16 Why wasn’t I a child who died at birth and was put in the ground? I wish I had been buried like a baby who never saw the light of day. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,"17 There the wicked stop causing trouble, and the weary find rest. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,18 Even prisoners find relief there; they no longer hear their guards shouting at them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,"19 Everyone—from the greatest to the least important—will be there, and even the slave is free from his master. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,20 “Why must a suffering person continue to live? * Why let anyone live such a bitter life?
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,"21 Such people want to die, but death does not come. They search for death more than for hidden treasure. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,22 They would be happy to find their grave. They would rejoice to find their tomb. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,23 But God keeps their future a secret and builds a wall around them to protect them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,"24 When it is time to eat, all I can do is sigh with sadness, not joy. My groans pour out like water. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,"25 I was afraid something terrible would happen, and what I feared most has happened. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,26 I cannot calm down or relax. I am too upset to rest!” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,3,4 Eliphaz Speaks 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,4,1 Eliphaz from Teman answered 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,4,2 “I must say something. Would it upset you if I speak? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,4,"3 Job, you have taught many people. You encouraged those who were ready to quit. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,4,4 Your words helped those who were ready to fall. You gave strength to those who could not stand by themselves. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,4,"5 But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged. Trouble hits you, and you are upset. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,4,"6 You worship God. You trust him. You are a good man, so let that be your hope. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,4,7 Can you think of any innocent person who was ever destroyed? Do you know of any place where good people are punished? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,4,"8 Yes, I have seen people whose lives were cut short, but they were evil troublemakers. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,4,9 They lost the breath God gave them. They were cut off from his breath of life. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,4,"10 They were like roaring lions, like growling lions with broken teeth— "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,4,"11 like a lioness that cannot find prey. They died, and their cubs starved to death. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,4,12 “I happened to hear a message. My ears caught a whisper of it. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,4,"13 Like a bad dream* in the night, it ruined my sleep. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,4,"14 It frightened me, * and I trembled down to my bones."
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,4,15 A spirit passed by my face. The hair on my body stood up! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,4,"16 The spirit stood still, but I could not see what it was. A shape stood before my eyes, and there was silence. Then I heard a quiet voice 17 ‘A person cannot be more right than God. People cannot be more pure than their Maker. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,4,17 ‘A person cannot be more right than God. People cannot be more pure than their Maker. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,4,"18 Look, God cannot even trust his heavenly servants. He sees faults even in his angels. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,4,19 So surely people are worse! They live in houses of clay† built on dust. They can be crushed as easily as a moth! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,4,20 From dawn to sunset people are destroyed. They die—gone forever—and no one even notices. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,4,"21 The ropes of their tent are pulled up, and they die before gaining wisdom.’ 5 "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,"1 “Job, call out if you want, and see if anyone answers! But to which of the angels will you turn? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,2 A fool’s anger will kill him. His jealousy will destroy him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,"3 I saw a fool who thought he was safe, but suddenly he died.* "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,4 There was no one to help his children. No one defended them in court. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,"5 Hungry people ate all his crops, even the grain growing among the thorns, and greedy people took all he had. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,6 Bad times don’t come up from the dirt. Trouble does not grow from the ground. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,"7 But people are born to have trouble, as surely as sparks rise from a fire. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,"8 If I were you, I would turn to God and tell him about my problems. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,9 People cannot understand the wonderful things God does. His miracles are too many to count. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,10 He sends rain all over the earth and waters the fields. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,11 He raises up the humble and makes sad people happy. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,12 He spoils the plans of even the smartest people so that they will not succeed. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,13 He catches those who think they are wise in their own clever traps and brings to an end their evil plans. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,14 Daylight will be like darkness for them. † Even at noon they will have to feel their way as in the dark.
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,15 God saves the poor from the hurtful words of the wicked. He saves them from those who are powerful. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,16 So the poor have hope; God shuts the mouths of those who would cause them harm. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,17 “You are fortunate when God corrects you. So don’t complain when God All-Powerful punishes you. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,"18 God might injure you, but he will bandage those wounds. He might hurt you, but his hands also heal. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,19 He will save you again and again. No evil will harm you.† 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,20 God will save you from death when there is famine. He will protect you from the sword when there is war. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,21 People might say bad things about you with their sharp tongues. But God will protect you. You will not be afraid when bad things happen! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,22 You will laugh at destruction and famine. You will not be afraid of wild animals! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,23 It is as if you have a peace treaty with the wild animals and the rocks in the field. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,24 You will live in peace because your tent is safe. You will count your property and find nothing missing. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,25 You will have many children. They will be as many as the blades of grass on the earth. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,"26 You will be like the wheat that grows until harvest time. Yes, you will live to a ripe old age. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,"27 “We have studied this and know it is true. So listen to us, and learn for yourself.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,5,6 Job Answers Eliphaz 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,1 Then Job answered 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,2 “I wish my suffering could be weighed and all my trouble be put on the scales. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,3 They would be heavier than all the sand of the sea! That is why my words are so crazy. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,4 God All-Powerful has shot me with his arrows. My spirit feels their poison! God’s terrible weapons are lined up against me. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,5 Even a wild donkey does not complain when it has grass to eat. And a cow is quiet when it has food. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,"6 Food without salt does not taste good, and the white of an egg has no taste. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,7 I refuse to touch that kind of food; † it makes me sick!
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,8 “I wish I could have what I ask for. I wish God would give me what I want. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,9 I wish he would crush me— just go ahead and kill me! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,"10 Then I would be comforted by this one thing Even through all this pain, I never refused to obey the commands of the Holy One. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,"11 “With my strength gone, I have no hope to go on living. With nothing to look forward to, why should I be patient? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,12 I am not strong like a rock. My body is not made from bronze. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,"13 I don’t have the power to help myself, because all hope of success has been taken away from me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,"14 “Friends should be loyal to you in times of trouble, even if you turn away from God All-Powerful.* "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,"15 But I cannot depend on you, my brothers. You are like a stream that has no water when the weather is dry but is flooded when the rains come. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,"16 In the winter, it is choked with ice and melting snow. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,"17 But when the weather is hot and dry, the water stops flowing, and the stream disappears. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,18 It twists and turns along the way and then disappears into the desert. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,19 Traders from Tema search for it. Travelers from Sheba hope to find it. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,"20 They are sure they can find water, but they will be disappointed. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,"21 Now, you are like those streams. You see my troubles and are afraid. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,22 But have I ever asked you to help me? Did I ask you to offer a bribe for me from your wealth? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,"23 No, and I never said, ‘Save me from my enemies!’ or ‘Save me from those who are cruel!’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,"24 “So now, teach me, and I will be quiet. Show me what I have done wrong. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,"25 Honest words are powerful, but your arguments prove nothing. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,26 Do you plan to criticize me? Will you speak more tiring words? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,27 Are you the kind of people who would gamble for orphans and sell out your own friends? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,"28 Now, look me in the face, and see that I am telling the truth! *"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,"29 You need to start over and stop being so unfair! Think again, because I am innocent. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,6,30 I am not lying. I know right from wrong. 7 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,7,1 “People have a hard struggle on earth. Their life is like that of a hired worker. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,7,2 They are like a slave looking for cool shade or a hired worker waiting for payday. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,7,3 Month after frustrating month has gone by. I have suffered night after night. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,7,"4 When I lie down, I think, ‘How long before it’s time to get up?’ The night drags on. I toss and turn until the sun comes up. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,7,5 My skin is covered with worms and scabs. It is cracked and covered with sores. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,7,"6 “My days pass by faster than a weaver’s shuttle,* and my life will end without hope. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,7,"7 God, remember, my life is like a breath. I will not get a second chance to enjoy it. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,7,"8 Those who see me now will never see me again. You watch me for a while, but then I am gone. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,7,"9 Just as clouds that come and go, people are put in the grave, never to rise again. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,7,10 They don’t come back to their old homes. The people there would not know them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,7,11 “So I will not be quiet! I will let my suffering spirit speak! I will let my bitter soul complain! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,7,12 Am I one of your enemies? Is that why you put a guard over me?† 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,7,13 My bed should bring me comfort. My couch should give me rest and relief. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,7,"14 But when I lie down, you scare me with dreams; you frighten me with visions. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,7,15 So I would rather be choked to death than to live like this. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,7,16 I hate my life—I give up. I don’t want to live forever. Leave me alone! My life means nothing. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,7,"17 God, why are people so important to you? Why do you even notice them? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,7,18 Why do you visit them every morning * and test them at every moment?
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,7,19 You never look away from me or leave me alone for a second. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,7,"20 You are always watching us! If I sinned, would that hurt you? Why have you made me your target? Have I become a problem for you? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,7,"21 Why don’t you just pardon me for doing wrong? Why don’t you just forgive me for my sins? Soon I will die and be in my grave. You will search for me, but I will be gone.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,7,8 Bildad Speaks to Job 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,1 Then Bildad from Shuah answered 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,2 “How long will you talk like that? Your words are nothing but hot air! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,3 God is always fair. God All-Powerful does what is right. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,"4 If your children sinned against God, he punished them. They paid for their sins. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,"5 But now, look to God and pray to the All-Powerful. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,"6 If you are pure and good, he will quickly come to help you. He will give your family back to you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,7 Then you will have a lot more than you had in the beginning! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,8 “Ask those who are now old. Find out what their ancestors learned. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,"9 It seems as though we were born yesterday. We are too young to know anything. Our days on earth are very short, like a shadow. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,10 Maybe the old people can tell you something. Maybe they will teach you what they learned. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,11 “Can papyrus grow tall on a dry land? Can reeds grow without water? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,"12 No, they will dry up before harvest. They will be too small to cut and use. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,13 People who forget God are like that. Those who oppose him have no hope. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,14 They have put their trust in something weak. It is like a spider’s web. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,"15 When they lean against it, it will break. When they reach out for it, it will not hold them up."
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,"16 Such people are like a vine that gets plenty of water and sunshine, and its branches spread throughout the garden. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,"17 Its roots spread among the rocks, searching for good soil. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,"18 But if you move it, it will die, and no one can tell it was ever there. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,"19 Everything might have been going well, but another vine will take its place. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,"20 God does not support evil people, and he does not abandon the innocent. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,21 So perhaps you might laugh again. Maybe shouts of joy will come from your lips. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,22 Maybe your enemies will be humiliated and the homes of the wicked destroyed.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,8,9 Job Answers Bildad 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,1 Then Job answered 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,"2 “Of course, I know that this is true. But how can a human being win an argument with God? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,3 Anyone who chose to argue with him could not answer one question in a thousand! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,4 God is so wise and powerful that no one could oppose him and survive. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,"5 When God is angry, he moves mountains before they know what happened. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,"6 He can shake the earth, and it will tremble down to its foundations. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,7 With one command he can stop the sun from rising. He can lock up the stars and keep them from shining. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,"8 He alone made the skies, and he walks on the ocean waves. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,"9 “God made the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades.* He made the planets that cross the southern sky.† "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,10 He does things too marvelous for people to understand. He does too many miracles to count! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,"11 When he passes by, I cannot see him. He goes right past me, and I don’t notice. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,"12 If he takes something away, no one can stop him. No one can say to him, ‘What are you doing?’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,13 God will not hold back his anger. Even Rahab’s helpers are afraid of him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,14 So I cannot argue with God. I would not know what to say to him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,"15 I am innocent, but I cannot give him an answer. All I can do is beg my Judge for mercy. *"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,"16 Even if I called and he answered, I cannot believe he would listen to me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,17 He would just send storms to crush me. He would give me more wounds for no reason. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,18 He would not let me catch my breath again. He would just give me more trouble. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,19 I cannot defeat God. He is too powerful! I cannot take him to court for justice. Who could force him to come? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,"20 I am innocent, but anything I say makes me seem guilty. I am innocent, but if I speak, my mouth proves me wrong. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,"21 I am innocent, but I don’t know what to think. I hate my own life. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,"22 So I say, ‘Does it make any difference? God destroys the innocent as well as the guilty.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,23 Is it God who laughs when a disaster kills innocent people? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,"24 Is it God who keeps the leaders from seeing when an evil person takes control? If it is not God, then who is it? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,25 “My days are passing faster than a runner. They are flying by without any joy. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,"26 They go by as quickly as papyrus boats, as fast as an eagle swooping down on its prey. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,"27 “I could say, ‘I will not complain. I will forget my pain and put a smile on my face.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,28 But the suffering still frightens me. I know that God will not see me as innocent. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,"29 I will be found guilty, so why should I even think about it? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,"30 Even if I scrubbed my hands with soap and washed myself whiter than snow, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,"31 God would still push me into the slime pit,‡ and even my clothes would hate to touch me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,"32 God is not a human like me, so I cannot argue with him. I cannot take him to court. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,"33 I wish there were someone who could listen to both sides,§ someone to judge both of us in a fair way. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,34 I wish someone could take away the threat of God’s punishment. Then he would not frighten me anymore. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,9,35 Then I could say what I want without being afraid of him. But I cannot do that now. 10 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,"1 “I hate my own life, so I will complain freely. I am very bitter, so now I will speak. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,"2 I will say to God, ‘Don’t just say I am guilty! Tell me what you have against me. ‡"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,3 Do you enjoy hurting me? Do you enjoy ignoring me while smiling at what evil people say? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,4 Do you have human eyes? Do you see things the way people do? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,5 Is your life as short as ours? Is your life as short as a man’s life? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,6 You look for my wrong and search for my sin. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,"7 You know I am innocent, but no one can save me from your power! "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,8 Your hands made me and shaped my body. But now they are closing around me and squeezing me to death! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,"9 Remember, you molded me like clay. Will you turn me into clay again? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,10 You poured me out like milk. You spun me around and squeezed me like someone making cheese. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,"11 You put me together with bones and muscles, and then you clothed me with skin and flesh. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,12 You gave me life and were very kind to me. You cared for me and watched over my spirit. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,13 But this is what you hid in your heart. Now I know what you were planning for me. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,"14 If I sinned, you would be watching me so that you could punish me for doing wrong. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,"15 If I sin, I am guilty and should be cursed. But even when I am innocent, I cannot lift up my head. I am so ashamed because of all the troubles I have. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,"16 If I have any success and feel proud, you hunt me down like a lion and show your power over me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,17 You bring witness after witness to prove that I am wrong. Again and again you show your anger as you send army after army against me. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,18 So why did you let me be born? I wish I had died before anyone saw me. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,19 I wish I had never lived. I wish they had carried me from my mother’s womb straight to the grave. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,20 My life is almost finished. So leave me alone! Let me enjoy the little time I have left. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,"21 I am going soon to the land of no return, the place of death and darkness— "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,"22 that land of darkest night, of shadows and confusion, where even the light is darkness.’ ”"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,10,11 Zophar Speaks to Job 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,11,"1 Then Zophar from Naamah answered Job and said, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,11,2 “This flood of words should be answered! Does all this talking make Job right? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,11,3 Do you think we don’t have an answer for you? Do you think no one will warn you when you laugh at God? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,11,"4 You say to God, ‘My arguments are right, and you can see I am pure.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,11,5 I wish God would answer you and tell you that you are wrong. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,11,6 He could tell you the secret of wisdom. He would tell you that every story has two sides. You can be sure of this God is not punishing you as much as he should. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,11,7 “Do you think you really understand God? Do you completely understand God All-Powerful? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,11,8 That knowledge is higher than the heavens and deeper than the place of death. So what can you do? How can you learn it all? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,11,9 It is greater than the earth and bigger than the seas. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,11,"10 “If God decides to arrest you and take you to court, no one could stop him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,11,"11 God knows who is worthless. When he sees evil, he remembers it. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,11,"12 A wild donkey cannot give birth to a man, and a stupid person will never become wise. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,11,13 Prepare your heart to serve only God. Lift your arms and pray to him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,11,14 Put away the sin that you still hold on to. Don’t keep evil in your tent. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,11,"15 If you will do that, you could look to God without shame. You can stand strong and not be afraid. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,11,"16 Then you can forget your troubles, like water that has already passed by. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,11,17 Your life will be brighter than the sunshine at noon. Life’s darkest hours will shine like the morning sun. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,11,18 You will feel safe because there is hope. God will protect you and give you rest. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,11,19 You will lie down without fear of anyone. Many people will come to you for help. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,11,"20 Evil people might look for help, but they will not escape their troubles. Their hope leads only to death.”"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,11,12 Job Answers His Friends 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,1 Then Job answered them 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,"2 “I’m sure you think you are the only wise people left. You think that when you die, wisdom will be gone with you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,3 But my mind is as good as yours. You aren’t any smarter than I am. You haven’t said anything that people don’t already know. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,"4 “My friends laugh at me now. They say, ‘He prayed to God and got his answer.’ I am a good, innocent man, but still they laugh at me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,5 Those who have no troubles make fun of those who do. They hit a man when he is down. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,"6 But robbers’ tents are not bothered. Those who make God angry live in peace, even though God has them in his power. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,"7 “But ask the animals, and they will teach you. Or ask the birds of the air, and they will tell you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,"8 Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you. Or let the fish in the sea tell you their wisdom. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,9 Everyone knows that the LORD made these things. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,10 Every animal that lives and everyone who breathes— they are all under God’s power. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,"11 But just as the tongue tastes food, the ears test the words they hear. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,"12 People say, ‘Wisdom is to be found in those who are old. Long life brings understanding.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,13 But wisdom and power belong to God. Good advice and understanding are his. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,14 Anything God tears down cannot be rebuilt. Anyone he puts in prison cannot be set free. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,"15 If he holds back the rain, the earth will dry up. If he lets the rain loose, it will flood the land. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,16 God is strong and always wins. He controls those who fool others and those who are fooled. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,17 He strips advisors of their wisdom and makes leaders act like fools. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,18 He strips kings of their authority and makes them slaves. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,19 He strips priests of their power and removes those who feel so secure in their position.
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,20 He makes trusted advisors be silent. He takes away the wisdom of the older leaders. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,21 He brings disgrace to important people. He takes power away from rulers. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,22 He exposes even the darkest secrets. He sends light into places that are as dark as death. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,"23 God makes nations great, and then he destroys them. He makes nations grow large, and then he scatters their people. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,24 He makes their leaders foolish. He makes them wander around in the desert. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,12,25 They are like someone feeling their way in the dark. They are like drunks who don’t know where they are going. 13 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,1 “I have seen all this before. I have already heard everything you say. I understand all these things. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,2 I know as much as you do. I am as smart as you are. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,3 But I don’t want to argue with you. I want to speak to God All-Powerful. I want to argue with God about my troubles. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,4 But you men try to cover up your ignorance with lies. You are like worthless doctors who cannot heal anyone. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,5 I wish you would just be quiet. That would be the wisest thing you could do. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,"6 “Now, listen to my argument. Listen to what I have to say. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,7 Will you speak lies for God? Do you really believe your lies are what God wants you to say? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,8 Are you trying to defend God against me? You are not being fair. You are choosing God’s side simply because he is God. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,"9 If God checked you very closely, would he see that you are right? Do you really think you can fool God the same as you fool people? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,10 You know that God would criticize you if you chose someone’s side simply because they were important. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,11 God’s majesty frightens you. You are afraid of him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,12 The wise sayings you quote are worthless. Your arguments are as weak as clay. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,13 “Be quiet and let me talk! I accept whatever happens to me. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,14 I will put myself in danger and take my life in my own hands.
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,15 I will continue to trust God even if he kills me.* But I will defend myself to his face. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,"16 And if he lets me live, it will be because I had the confidence to speak. No guilty person would dare meet God face to face. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,17 Listen carefully to what I say. Let me explain. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,18 I am ready now to defend myself. I will carefully present my arguments. I know I will be shown to be right. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,"19 If anyone can prove I am wrong, I will shut up and wait to die. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,"20 “God, just give me two things, and then I will not hide from you "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,"22 Then call to me, and I will answer you. Or let me speak, and you answer me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,23 How many sins have I committed? What wrongs have I done? Show me where I went wrong or how I sinned. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,"24 God, why do you avoid me and treat me like your enemy? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,25 Are you trying to scare me? I am only a leaf blowing in the wind. You are attacking a piece of straw! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,26 You have a list of terrible charges against me. Are you making me suffer for the sins I did when I was young? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,27 You have put chains on my feet. You watch every step I take. You see every move I make. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,13,"28 So I am becoming weaker and weaker, like a piece of wood rotting away, like a piece of cloth eaten by moths. 14 "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,14,1 “We are all human beings.* Our life is short and full of trouble. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,14,2 Our life is like a flower that grows quickly and then dies away. Our life is like a shadow that is here for a short time and then is gone. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,14,"3 God, do you need to keep an eye on something so small? Why bother to bring charges against me? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,14,4 “No one can make something clean from something so dirty. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,14,5 The length of our life has been decided. You alone know how long that is. You have set the limits for us and nothing can change them. *
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,14,"6 So stop watching us; leave us alone, and let us enjoy this hard life until we have put in our time. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,14,"7 “There is always hope for a tree. If it is cut down, it can grow again. It will keep sending out new branches. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,14,"8 Its roots might grow old in the ground and its stump die in the dirt, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,14,"9 but with water, it will grow again. It will grow branches like a new plant. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,14,"10 But when a man dies, he becomes weak and sick, and then he is gone! "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,14,"11 Like a lake that goes dry or a river that loses its source, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,14,"12 so people lose their lives, never to live again. The skies will all pass away before they rise from death. The skies will all disappear before anyone wakes up from that sleep! "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,14,"13 “I wish you would hide me in my grave. I wish you would hide me there, until your anger is gone. Then you could pick a time to remember me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,14,"14 If a man dies, will he live again? If so, I would gladly suffer through this time waiting for my release.† "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,14,"15 God, you would call me, and I would answer you. Then I, the one you made, would be important to you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,14,"16 You would still watch every step I take, but you would not remember my sins. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,14,17 It would be as if you had sealed my sins in a bag. It would be as if you had covered my guilt with plaster. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,14,18 “Mountains fall and crumble away. Large rocks break loose and fall. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,14,"19 Water flowing over stones wears them down. Floods wash away the soil on the ground. In the same way, God, you destroy the hope people have. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,14,20 You defeat them completely and then they are gone. You change the way they look and send them away forever to the place of death. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,14,"21 If their sons are honored, they will never know it. If their sons do wrong, they will never see it. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,1 Then Eliphaz from Teman answered Job 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,"2 “If you were really wise, you would not answer with your worthless personal opinions! A wise man would not be so full of hot air. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,3 Do you think a wise man would use empty words and meaningless speeches to win his arguments? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,"4 If you had your way, no one would respect God and pray to him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,"5 What you say clearly shows your sin. Job, you are trying to hide your sin by using clever words. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,6 I don’t need to prove to you that you are wrong. The words from your own mouth show that you are wrong. Your own lips speak against you. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,7 “Do you think you were the first person ever to be born? Were you born before the hills? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,8 Did you listen to God’s secret plans? Do you think you are the only wise person? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,9 We know as much as you do! We understand as well as you. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,"10 The old, gray-haired men agree with us. People older than your father are on our side. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,"11 God tries to comfort you, but that is not enough for you. We have spoken his message to you in a gentle way. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,12 Why will you not understand? Why can you not see the truth? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,13 You are expressing your anger against God when you say these things. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,14 “People cannot really be pure. They* cannot be more right than God! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,15 God does not even trust his angels.† He does not even think the sky is pure.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,"17 “Listen to me, and I will explain it to you. Let me tell you what I have seen. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,"18 I will tell you what wise men would say, things they heard from their fathers and then freely passed on. They didn’t hide any secrets from me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,19 These are important people in our country! Everyone knows who they are. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,20 And they said that an evil man suffers all his life. A cruel man suffers all his numbered years. *
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,21 Every noise scares him. His enemy will attack him when he thinks he is safe. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,22 An evil man has no hope of escaping the darkness. There is a sword somewhere waiting to kill him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,"23 He wanders from place to place, looking for food. But he knows a dark day is coming, which he brought on himself. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,"24 He lives in fear, with worry and suffering threatening him like a king ready to attack. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,"25 That is because that evil man shook his fist at God, refusing to obey. He dared to attack God All-Powerful, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,"26 like a soldier with a thick, strong shield who runs at his enemy to strike him in the neck. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,"27 He might be rich and fat, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,28 but his town will be ruined; his home will be destroyed; his house will be empty. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,29 He will not be rich for long. His wealth will not last. His crops will not grow large. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,30 He will not escape the darkness. He will be like a tree whose leaves die from disease and are blown away by the wind. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,"31 That evil man should not fool himself by trusting in worthless things, because he will keep nothing. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,"32 He will die before his time, like a tree whose top branches have already begun to die. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,33 He will be like a vine that loses its grapes before they ripen. He will be like an olive tree that loses its buds. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,34 That is because people without God have nothing. Those who take bribes will have their homes destroyed by fire. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,15,35 They are always thinking of ways to do evil and cause trouble. They are always planning how they might cheat others.”

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,16,1 Then Job answered 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,16,"2 “I have heard all these things before. You men give me trouble, not comfort. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,16,3 Your long speeches never end! Why do you continue arguing? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,16,"4 I also could say the same things you say, if you had my troubles. I could say wise things against you and shake my head at you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,16,5 But I would say things to encourage you and give you hope. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,16,6 “Nothing I say makes my pain go away. But keeping quiet does not help either.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,16,"21 He speaks to God for me, like someone‡ presenting an argument for a friend. "

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,17,7 My eyes are almost blind from my grief. My whole body is as thin as a shadow. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,17,8 Good people wonder how this could happen. The innocent are upset with anyone who is against God.

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,26,14 These are only a few of the amazing things God has done. We hear only a small whisper of God’s thundering power.” 27 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,1 Job continued his answer 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,"2 “God All-Powerful has been unfair to me; he has made my life bitter. But I swear by his life, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,"3 as long as I have life in me, as long as breath from God is in my nostrils, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,4 I will not be a hypocrite. I will not lie. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,5 You will never hear me say you men are right! Until the day I die I will not be untrue to myself. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,6 I will hold on to my innocence and never let go! My conscience will always be clear! *
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,7 May my enemies be punished like those who are evil. May those who stood against me end up like all who have done wrong. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,"8 What hope do people without God have when it is time to die, when God takes their life away? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,"9 When they have troubles and cry out for help, God will not listen to them! "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,10 It will be too late for them to enjoy talking with God All-Powerful. They should have prayed to God all the time. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,11 “I will teach you about God’s power. I will not hide anything about God All-Powerful. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,12 But you have seen it all with your own eyes. So why do you say such useless things? 13 * “Here is what God has planned for those who are evil. This is what cruel people will get from God All-Powerful. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,13 * “Here is what God has planned for those who are evil. This is what cruel people will get from God All-Powerful. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,"14 They may have many children, but all of them will be killed in war. Or their children will not have enough to eat. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,"15 All those who are left will die, and the widows will not even cry for them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,16 Evil people collect silver as easily as dirt. They may have so many clothes that they are piled up like clay. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,17 But their piles of clothes will be worn by those who have lived right. All that silver will be given to those who have done no wrong. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,"18 Evil people might build houses, but they will not last long. They will be like a spider’s web or a guard’s tent. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,"19 They might be rich when they go to bed, but when they open their eyes, all their riches will be gone. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,"20 Terrible fears will come over them like a flood, like a storm in the night that blows everything away. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,"21 The east wind will carry them away, and they will be gone. The storm will sweep them out of their homes. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,"22 They may try to run away from the power of the storm, but it will come down on them without mercy. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,23 It will make a sound like clapping hands as they run away. It will whistle at them as they run from their homes.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,27,28 The Value of Wisdom 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,1 “There are mines where people get silver and places where people melt gold to make it pure. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,"2 Iron is dug out of the ground, and copper is melted out of the rocks. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,3 Miners carry lights deep into caves to search for these rocks in the deepest darkness. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,"4 Far from where people live, they dig deep into the ground, down where no one else has been before. There they work all alone, hanging from ropes. *"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,"5 Food grows on the ground above. But underground it is different, as if everything were melted by fire. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,6 In the rocks there are sapphires and grains of pure gold. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,7 Wild birds know nothing about the way to these places. No falcon* has ever seen it. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,8 Wild animals have never been there. Lions have not traveled that way. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,9 Miners dig the hardest rocks. They dig away at the mountains and make them bare. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,10 They cut tunnels through the rocks and see all the treasures they hold. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,11 They even find places where rivers begin. They bring to light what once was hidden. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,12 “But where can anyone find wisdom? Where can we get understanding? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,13 People don’t know where wisdom is. It cannot be found by anyone on earth. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,"14 The deep ocean says, ‘It’s not here with me.’ The sea says, ‘It’s not here with me.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,15 You cannot buy wisdom with even the purest gold. There’s not enough silver in the world to pay for it. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,16 You cannot buy it with gold from Ophir or with precious onyx or sapphires. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,17 Wisdom is worth more than gold or crystal. It cannot be bought with expensive jewels set in gold. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,"18 It is far more valuable than coral and jasper, more precious than rubies. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,"19 The topaz from Ethiopia cannot match its value, which is greater than the purest gold. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,20 “So where does wisdom come from? Where can we find understanding? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,21 Wisdom is hidden from every living thing on earth. Even birds in the sky cannot see it. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,"22 Death and destruction† say, ‘We have never seen wisdom; we have only heard rumors about it.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,23 “Only God knows the way to wisdom. Only he knows where wisdom is. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,24 He can see to the very ends of the earth. He sees everything under the sky. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,25 God gave the wind its power. He decided how big to make the oceans. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,26 He decided where to send the rain and where the thunderstorms should go. *
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,27 He looked at wisdom and discussed it. He examined it and saw how much it is worth. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,"28 Then he said to humans, ‘To fear and respect the Lord is wisdom. To turn away from evil is understanding.’ ” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,28,29 Job Continues His Speech 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,1 Job continued to speak 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,"2 “I wish my life could be the same as it was a few months ago, when God watched over me and cared for me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,"3 God’s light shined above me, so I could walk through the darkness. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,"4 I wish for the days when I was successful, when I enjoyed God’s friendship and blessing in my home. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,"5 God All-Powerful was still with me then, and my children were all around me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,6 Life was so good that I washed my feet in cream and had plenty of the finest oils.* 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,7 “Those were the days when I went to the city gate and sat in the public meeting of the elders. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,"8 When the young men saw me coming, they stepped out of my way. And the old men stood up to show they respected me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,9 The leaders of the people stopped talking and put their hands over their mouths. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,"10 Even the most important leaders were quiet, as if their tongues were stuck to the roof of their mouths. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,"11 All who heard me said good things about me. Those who saw what I did praised me, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,12 because I helped the poor when they cried out. I helped the orphans who had no one to care for them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,13 People who were dying asked God to bless me. My help brought joy to widows in need. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,14 Right living was my clothing. Fairness was my robe and turban. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,"15 I was like eyes for the blind, like feet for the crippled. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,16 I was like a father to the poor. I helped people I didn’t even know win their case in court. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,17 I stopped evil people from abusing their power and saved innocent people from them.† 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,"18 “I always thought I would live a long life, growing old with my family around me. *"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,19 I was like a healthy plant with roots that have plenty of water and branches that are wet with dew. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,20 I thought each new day would bring more honor and be full of new possibilities.‡ 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,21 “In the past people listened to me. They waited quietly for my advice. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,"22 When I finished speaking, they had nothing more to say. My words fell gently on their ears. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,23 They waited for my words as they would for rain. They drank them in like rain in the springtime. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,"24 I smiled at them, and they could hardly believe it. My smile made them feel better. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,29,"25 I was their leader and made decisions about their future. I was like a king among his troops, comforting those who were sad. 30 "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,1 “But now men younger than I make fun of me— men whose fathers were too worthless to put with my sheep dogs. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,2 Their fathers are still too weak to be of any use to me. All their strength is gone. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,"3 They are starving with nothing to eat, so they chew on the dry, ruined land. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,4 They pull up salt plants in the desert and eat the roots from the broom tree. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,"5 They are forced away from other people, who shout at them as if they were thieves. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,"6 They must live in the dry riverbeds, hillside caves, and holes in the ground. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,7 They howl in the bushes and huddle together under thornbushes. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,"8 They are a bunch of worthless people without names, who were forced to leave their country. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,9 “Now their sons sing songs to make fun of me. My name has become a bad word to them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,"10 They hate me and stay far away from me, except when they come to spit in my face! "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,"11 God has taken the string from my bow and made me weak, so they feel free to do whatever they want to me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,12 They attack me on my right side. They knock my feet out from under me. They build ramps to attack and destroy me like a city. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,"13 They guard the road so that I cannot escape. They succeed in destroying me, without help from anyone. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,"14 They break a hole in the wall and come rushing through it, and the crashing rocks fall on me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,15 I am shaking with fear. ‡ They chased my honor away like dust in the wind.My safety disappears like a cloud.
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,"16 “Now my life is almost gone, and soon I will die. Days of suffering have grabbed me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,17 All my bones ache at night. Pain never stops chewing on me. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,18 God grabbed the collar of my coat and twisted my clothes out of shape. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,"19 He threw me into the mud, and I became like dust and ashes. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,"20 “God, I cry out to you for help, but you don’t answer. I stand up and pray, but you don’t pay attention to me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,21 You have become cruel to me; you use your power to hurt me. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,22 You let the strong wind blow me away. You throw me around in the storm. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,"23 I know you will lead me to my death, to that place where all the living must go. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,"24 “Surely no one would attack a man who is already ruined, when he is hurt and crying for help. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,"25 God, you know that I cried for those who were in trouble. You know that I mourned for the poor. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,"26 But when I hoped for good, trouble came instead. When I looked for light, darkness came. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,27 I constantly feel upset. And my suffering has only just begun. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,"28 I am always sad and depressed, without any relief. I stand up in the public meeting and cry for help, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,"29 making sad sounds like the wild dogs, like the ostriches in the desert. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,30 My skin is burned and peeling away. My body is hot with fever. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,30,31 My harp is tuned to play songs of sorrow. My flute makes sad sounds like someone crying. 31 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,1 “I made an agreement with my eyes not to look at a young woman in a way that would make me want her. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,2 What does God above have for us? How does God All-Powerful repay people from his home high in heaven?* 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,3 He sends trouble to the wicked and disaster to those who do wrong. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,4 God is the one who knows what I do and sees every step I take. *
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,5 “I have not lied to anyone. I never tried to cheat people. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,"6 If God would use accurate scales,† he would know that I am innocent. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,"7 If I ever stepped off the right path, if my eyes led my heart to do evil, or if my hands are dirty with sin, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,8 then let others eat what I planted. Let my crops be pulled up by the roots. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,"9 “If I have desired another woman or waited at my neighbor’s door to sin with his wife, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,"10 then let my wife serve someone else, and let other men sleep with her. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,"11 To do such a thing would be shameful, a sin that must be punished. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,12 Such sin is like a fire that burns until it destroys everything. It would completely ruin my life’s work. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,"13 “If I refused to be fair to my slaves when they had a complaint against me, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,14 then what will I do when I must face God? What will I say when he asks me to explain what I did? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,15 The one who made me in my mother’s womb also made them. God shaped us all inside our mothers. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,16 “I have never refused to help the poor. I always gave widows what they needed. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,17 I have never been selfish with my food. I shared what I had with orphans. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,18 All my life I have been like a father to orphans and have taken care of widows. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,"19 Whenever I found people suffering because they didn’t have clothes or saw a poor man with no coat, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,20 I always gave them something to wear. I used the wool from my own sheep to make them warm. And they thanked me with all their heart. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,"21 I never threatened an orphan, even when I knew I had support in court.‡ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,"22 If I ever did that, may my arm be pulled from its socket and fall from my shoulder! "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,23 But I didn’t do any of these bad things. I fear God’s punishment too much. His majesty scares me.§ 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,"24 “I have never trusted in riches. I never said even to pure gold, ‘You are my hope.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,"25 I have been wealthy, † but that didn’t make me proud.I earned a lot of money,but that is not what made me happy."
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,26 I have never worshiped the bright sun or the beautiful moon. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,27 I was never foolish enough to worship the sun and the moon. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,"28 This is also a sin that must be punished. If I had worshiped them, I would have been unfaithful to God All-Powerful. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,29 “I have never been happy when my enemies were destroyed. I have never laughed at my enemies when bad things happened to them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,30 I have never let my mouth sin by cursing my enemies and wishing for them to die. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,31 The people in my house know that I have never let anyone go hungry. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,32 I always invited strangers into my home so that they would not have to sleep in the streets. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,33 I have not tried to hide my sins as some people do. I have never hidden my guilt. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,34 I was never so afraid of what people might say or of making enemies that I kept my sins secret and avoided going out. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,35 “How I wish someone would listen to me! I will sign my name to all I have said. Now let God All-Powerful answer me. Let him make a list of what he thinks I did wrong. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,36 I would wear it around my neck. I would put it on my head like a crown. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,37 Then I could explain everything I have done. I could come to God with my head held high like a prince. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,38 “I did not use my land in a wrong way. I never caused it to suffer. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,39 I always paid the workers for the food I got from the land. I never let any of them starve. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,"40 If I ever did any of these bad things, let thorns and weeds grow in my fields instead of wheat and barley!” Job’s words are finished. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,31,32 Elihu Adds to the Argument 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,32,"1 Then Job’s three friends gave up trying to answer him, because he was so sure that he was innocent. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,32,2 But there was a young man there named Elihu son of Barakel. He was a descendant of a man named Buz. Elihu was from the family of Ram. He became very angry because Job kept saying he was innocent—that he was right and God was wrong. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,32,"3 Elihu was also angry with Job’s three friends because they could not answer him, and yet they still considered him guilty of doing wrong. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,32,"4 Elihu was the youngest one there, so he had waited until everyone finished talking. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,32,"5 But when he saw that Job’s three friends had nothing more to say, his anger forced him to speak. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,32,"6 So here’s what Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said “I am only a young man, and you are all older. That is why I was afraid to tell you what I think. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,32,"7 I thought to myself, ‘Older people should speak first. They have lived many years, so they have learned many things.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,32,"8 But it is the spirit in people, the breath from God All-Powerful, that makes them understand. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,32,9 Old men are not the only wise people. They are not the only ones who understand what is right. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,32,"10 “So please listen to me, and I will tell you what I think. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,32,11 I waited patiently while you men talked. I listened to the answers you gave as you searched for the right words. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,32,12 I listened carefully to what you said. Not one of you proved Job wrong. Not one of you answered his arguments. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,32,"13 You men cannot say that you have found wisdom. The answer to Job’s arguments must come from God, not people. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,32,"14 Job was arguing with you, not me, so I will not use your arguments to answer him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,32,"15 “Job, these men lost the argument. They don’t have anything more to say. They don’t have any more answers. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,32,16 I waited for them to answer you. But now they are quiet. They stand there with nothing more to say. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,32,"17 So now I will give you my answer. Yes, I will tell you what I think. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,32,18 I have so much to say that I cannot hold it in. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,32,19 I feel like a jar of wine that has never been opened. I am like a new wineskin ready to burst. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,32,20 I must speak so that I will feel better. I must answer your arguments. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,32,21 I will treat you the same as I would treat anyone else. I will not praise you to win your favor. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,32,"22 I cannot treat one person better than another. If I did, God my Maker would punish me! 33 "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,"1 “Now, Job, listen to me. Listen carefully to what I say. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,2 I am ready to speak. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,"3 My heart is honest, so my words are sincere. I will speak the truth about what I know."
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,4 God’s Spirit made me. My life comes from God All-Powerful. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,5 Listen to me and answer if you can. Get your arguments ready to face me. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,6 You and I are the same before God. He used clay to make us both. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,7 Don’t be afraid of me. I will not be hard on you. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,"8 “But, Job, I heard what you said. These were your very words 9 ‘I am pure and innocent; I did nothing wrong; I am not guilty! "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,9 ‘I am pure and innocent; I did nothing wrong; I am not guilty! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,10 But God found an excuse to attack me. He treats me like an enemy. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,11 He put chains on my feet and watches everything I do.’ 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,"12 “But you are wrong about this, and I will prove it to you. God knows more than any of us.* "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,13 You are arguing with God! Why do you think he should explain everything to you? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,14 But maybe God does explain what he does but speaks in ways that people don’t understand. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,"15 He may speak in a dream, or in a vision at night, when people are in a deep sleep lying in their beds. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,"16 He may whisper something in their ear, and they are frightened when they hear his warnings. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,17 God warns people to stop them from doing wrong and to keep them from becoming proud. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,18 He does this to save them from death.† He wants to keep them from being destroyed. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,19 “Or those who are sick in bed might be suffering punishment from God. The pain that makes their bones ache might be a warning from him. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,20 They feel so bad they cannot eat. Even the best food makes them sick. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,21 Their bodies might waste away until they become thin and all their bones stick out. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,"22 They might be close to death, their lives about to end. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,"23 But maybe one of God’s thousands of angels is watching over them, to speak for them and tell about the good things they have done. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,"24 Maybe the angel will be kind and say to God, ‘Save this one from the place of death! I have found a way to pay for his life.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,25 Then that person’s body will become young and strong again. He will be as he was when he was young. *
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,26 He will pray and God will answer. He will worship God and shout with joy. He will again stand as right before God. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,"27 He will tell everyone, ‘I sinned. I changed good into bad, but God didn’t give me the punishment I deserved! "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,28 God saved me from going down to the place of death. Now I can enjoy life again.’ 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,29 “God does all these things for people again and again. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,30 He wants them to be saved from death so that they can enjoy life. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,"31 “Job, pay attention and listen to me. Be quiet and let me talk. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,"32 But if you have an answer, go ahead and speak. Tell me your argument. I would be happy to know that you are innocent! "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,33,"33 But if you have nothing to say, then listen to me. Be quiet, and I will teach you wisdom.” 34 "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,1 Then Elihu continued his speech 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,"2 “Listen to what I say, you wise men. Pay attention, you who know so much. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,"3 Your tongue tastes the food it touches, and your ear tests the words it hears. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,4 So let us test these arguments and decide for ourselves what is right. Together we will learn what is good. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,"5 Job says, ‘I am innocent, and God is not being fair to me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,"6 I am right, but I am judged to be a liar. I have done no wrong, but I am badly hurt.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,7 “Would anyone but Job say such things? He has more thirst for insulting God than for water. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,8 He is a friend of evil people. He likes to spend time with the wicked. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,"9 I know this because he says, ‘You will gain nothing if you try to please God.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,"10 “You men can understand, so listen to me. God would never do what is evil! God All-Powerful would never do wrong. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,11 He pays us back for what we have done. He gives us what we deserve. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,12 The truth is that God does no wrong. God All-Powerful is always fair. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,13 No one chose God to be in charge of the earth. No one gave him responsibility for the whole world.
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,"14 If God decided to take away his spirit and the breath of life he gave us, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,15 then everything on earth would die. We would all become dust again. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,"16 “If you men are wise, you will listen to what I say. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,"17 Can someone be a ruler if he hates justice? Job, God is not only powerful, but he is fair. Do you think you can judge him guilty? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,"18 God is the one who says to kings, ‘You are worthless!’ He says to leaders, ‘You are evil!’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,19 He does not respect leaders more than other people. And he does not respect the rich more than the poor. God made everyone. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,"20 Any of us can die suddenly, in the middle of the night. Anyone can get sick and pass away. Even powerful people die for no reason we can see. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,21 “God watches what people do. He sees every step they take. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,22 There is no place dark enough for evil people to hide from God. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,23 God does not need to set a time for people to come before him and be judged. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,"24 He does not have to ask questions when people do wrong, even if they are powerful leaders. He simply destroys them and chooses others to take their place. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,"25 When he learns what people have done, he defeats them, and overnight they are gone. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,"26 He will punish them for the evil they have done, and he will do it where everyone can see. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,27 He will do this because they rebelled against him and ignored what he wanted. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,28 They hurt the poor and made them cry to God for help. And he hears their cry! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,"29 But if God decides not to help them, no one can judge him guilty. If he hides himself, no one can find him. He is the ruler over every person and nation. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,30 He keeps the wicked from ruling so that they will not bring harm to the people. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,"31 “A person should say to God, ‘I am guilty; I will not sin anymore. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,"32 Show me the sins I am not able to see. If I have done wrong, I will not do it again.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,"33 Job, you want God to reward you, but you refuse to change. It is your decision, not mine.Tell me what you think."
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,"34 A wise person would listen to me. A wise person would say, 35 ‘Job talks like an ignorant person. What he says doesn’t make sense!’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,35 ‘Job talks like an ignorant person. What he says doesn’t make sense!’ 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,"36 I think Job should be punished even more, because he answers us like someone who is evil! "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,34,37 He adds rebellion to his other sins. He sits there insulting us and arguing with God!” 35 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,35,"1 Elihu continued talking and said, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,35,"2 “Job, it is not fair for you to say, ‘I am more right than God,’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,35,"3 because you also ask him, ‘What’s the use of trying to please you? What good will it do me if I don’t sin?’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,35,"4 “Job, I want to answer you and your friends here with you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,35,"5 Look up at the sky. Look at the clouds, which are so much higher than you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,35,"6 If you sin, it does not hurt God. Even if your sins are too many to count, that does nothing to God. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,35,"7 And if you are good, that does not help God. He gets nothing from you. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,35,"8 Job, the good and bad things you do affect only other people like yourself. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,35,"9 “If people are being hurt, they cry out and beg for protection from those who hurt them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,35,"10 But they forget to say, ‘Where is God, the one who made me? He is the one who gives us songs to sing in the night. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,35,11 He is the one who makes us smarter than any animal on earth and wiser than any bird.’ 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,35,"12 “Or if evil people ask God for help, he will not answer them, because they are too proud. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,35,13 God will not listen to their worthless begging. God All-Powerful will not pay attention to them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,35,"14 So, Job, God will not listen to you when you say that you don’t see him. You say you are waiting for your chance to meet with him and prove that you are innocent. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,35,15 “Job thinks that God does not punish evil and that he pays no attention to sin. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,35,16 So he continues his worthless talking. Everything he has said shows he does not know what he is talking about.”
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,"1 Elihu continued talking and said, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,2 “Be patient with me a little longer. God has a few more words that he wants me to say. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,3 I will share my knowledge with everyone. I will prove that my Maker is right. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,"4 Job, I am telling the truth. I know what I am talking about. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,"5 “God is very powerful, but he does not hate people. He is very powerful, but he is also very wise. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,6 He will not let evil people live. He brings justice to the poor. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,7 He watches over those who live right. He lets them rule in high places. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,"8 So if people are punished, if they are tied with chains and ropes, they did something wrong. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,"9 And God will tell them what they did, that they sinned and were proud. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,10 He will force them to listen to his warning. He will command them to stop sinning. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,"11 If they serve and obey him, he will make them successful and they will live a happy life. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,"12 But if they refuse to obey him, they will be destroyed. They will die like fools. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,"13 “People who don’t care about God are always bitter. Even when he punishes them, they refuse to pray to him for help. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,"14 They will die while they are still young, like the male prostitutes. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,15 God saves those who suffer by using their suffering. He uses their troubles to speak in a way that makes them listen. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,"16 “In fact, God wants to help you out of your troubles. He wants to take away your burdens that are crushing you. He wants to load your table with plenty of food. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,"17 But you are full of this talk about guilt, judgment, and justice! "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,"18 Job, don’t let your anger fill you with doubt about God. And don’t let the price of forgiveness turn you away. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,19 Do you think your wealth will keep you out of trouble? Will your great strength be of any help to you now? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,20 Don’t be like those who wish darkness would come and hide them. They try to disappear into the night.* 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,"21 Job, don’t let your suffering cause you to choose evil. Be careful not to do wrong. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,"22 “Look, God’s power makes him great! He is the greatest teacher of all. *"
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,"23 No one can tell him what to do. No one can say, ‘God, you have done wrong.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,"24 Remember to praise him for what he has done, as many others have done in song. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,"25 Everyone can see what he has done, even people in faraway countries. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,"26 Yes, God is great, but we cannot understand his greatness. We don’t know how long he has lived. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,27 “God takes up water from the earth and changes it into mist and rain. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,"28 So the clouds pour out the water, and the rain falls on many people. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,29 No one can understand how he spreads the clouds out or how the thunder rumbles from his home in the sky. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,"30 Look, he spreads lightning all over the sky and covers the deepest part of the ocean. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,31 He uses them to control the nations and to give them plenty of food. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,"32 He grabs the lightning with his hands, and commands it to strike where he wants. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,36,33 The thunder warns that a storm is coming. So even the cattle know it is near. 37 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,1 “The thunder and lightning frighten me; my heart pounds in my chest. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,2 Listen to God’s thundering voice! Listen to the sound coming from his mouth. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,3 He sends his lightning to flash across the whole sky. It lights up the earth from one end to the other. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,"4 After the flashes of lightning you can hear his roaring voice. He thunders with his wonderful voice! And while his voice thunders, the lightning flashes continue. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,5 God’s thundering voice is amazing! He does great things that we cannot understand. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,"6 He says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth.’ And he says to the rain, ‘Pour down on the earth.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,7 God does this to stop everyone’s work and to show the people he made what he can do. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,8 The animals run into their dens and stay there. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,9 Whirlwinds come from the south. The cold winds come from the north. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,10 God’s breath makes ice and freezes even large bodies of water. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,11 He fills the clouds with water and scatters his lightning through them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,12 He orders the clouds to be blown all around the earth. The clouds do whatever he commands. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,13 He causes the clouds to punish people with floods or to water his earth and show his love.
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,"14 “Job, stop for a minute and listen. Think about the wonderful things God does. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,15 Do you know how God controls the clouds? Do you know how he makes his lightning flash? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,16 Do you know how the clouds hang in the sky? This is just one of the amazing works of the one who knows everything. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,"17 All you know is that you sweat, your clothes stick to you, and all is still and quiet when the heat wave comes from the south. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,18 Can you help God spread out the sky and make it shine like polished brass? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,"19 “Job, tell us what we should say to God! We cannot think of what to say because of our ignorance.* "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,20 I would not tell God that I wanted to talk to him. That would be like asking to be destroyed. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,21 A person cannot look at the sun. It is too bright as it shines in the sky after the wind blows the clouds away. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,22 In the same way God’s golden glory shines from the Holy Mountain.† He is surrounded by the brightest light. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,23 We have seen that God All-Powerful really is all powerful! But he is just and never treats anyone unfairly.‡ 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,24 That is why people fear and respect him. He shows no respect for those who think they are wise.” 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,37,38 God Speaks to Job 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,"1 Then the LORD spoke to Job from a whirlwind and said, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,2 “Who is this ignorant person saying these foolish things?* 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,3 Brace yourself† and get ready to answer the questions I will ask you. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,"4 “Where were you when I made the earth? If you are so smart, answer me. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,5 And who decided how big the earth should be? Who measured it with a measuring line? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,6 What is the earth resting on? Who put the first stone in its place 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,7 when the morning stars sang together and the angels‡ shouted with joy? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,8 “Who closed the flood gates as the sea gushed from the womb? *
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,9 Who covered it with clouds and wrapped it in darkness? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,10 I set the limits for the sea and put it behind locked gates. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,"11 I said to the sea, ‘You can come this far, but no farther. This is where your proud waves will stop.’ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,12 “Did you ever in your life command the morning to begin or the day to dawn? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,13 Did you ever tell the morning light to grab the earth and shake those who are evil out of their hiding places? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,"14 The morning light makes the hills and valleys easy to see. When the daylight comes to the earth, the shapes of these places stand out like the folds of a coat. They take shape like soft clay that is pressed with a stamp. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,"15 Evil people don’t like the daylight. When it shines bright, it keeps them from doing the bad things they do. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,16 “Have you ever gone to the deepest parts of the sea? Have you ever walked on the ocean bottom? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,17 Has anyone shown you the gates to the world of the dead? Have you ever seen those gates that lead to the dark place of death? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,"18 Do you really understand how big the earth is? Tell me, if you know all this. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,19 “Where does light come from? Where does darkness come from? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,20 Can you take them back to where they belong? Do you know how to get there? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,"21 Surely you know these things, since you are so old and wise. You were alive when I made them, weren’t you?§ "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,22 “Have you ever gone into the storerooms where I keep the snow and the hail? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,"23 I save them there for times of trouble, for the times of war and battle. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,"24 Have you ever gone to the place where the sun comes up, where it makes the east wind blow all over the earth?* "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,25 Who dug ditches in the sky for the heavy rain? Who made a path for the thunderstorm? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,26 Who makes it rain even in desert places where no one lives? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,"27 The rain gives that dry empty land all the water it needs, and grass begins to grow. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,28 Does the rain have a father? Who produces the drops of dew? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,29 Does ice have a mother? Who gives birth to the frost? §
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,30 That’s when the water freezes as hard as a rock. Even the deep sea freezes over! 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,31 “Can you tie up the Pleiades†? Can you unfasten the belt of Orion‡? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,32 Can you bring out the other constellations§ at the right times? Can you lead out the Bear* with its cubs? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,33 Do you know the laws that control the sky? Can you put each star in its place above the earth?† 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,34 “Can you shout at the clouds and command them to cover you with rain? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,"35 Can you give a command to the lightning? Will it come to you and say, ‘Here we are; what do you want, sir?’ Will it go wherever you want it to go? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,36 “Who makes people wise? Who puts wisdom deep inside them? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,37 Who is wise enough to count the clouds and tip them over to pour out their rain? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,"38 The rain makes the dust become mud, and the clumps of dirt stick together. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,39 “Do you find food for the lions? Do you feed their hungry babies? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,"40 No, they hide in their caves or wait in the grass, ready to attack their prey. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,38,41 Who feeds the ravens when their babies cry out to God and wander around without food? 39 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,1 “Do you know when the mountain goats are born? Do you watch when the mother deer gives birth?

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,"3 These animals lie down, they feel their birth pains, and their babies are born. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,4 Their babies grow strong out in the wild. Then they leave their mothers and never come back. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,5 “Who let the wild donkeys go free? Who untied their ropes and let them loose? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,6 I let the wild donkey have the desert for a home. I gave the salt lands to them for a place to live. †
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,7 They are happy to be away from the noise of the city. They never have to listen to their drivers shouting at them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,8 They live in the mountains. That is their pasture. That is where they look for food to eat. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,9 “Will a wild bull agree to serve you? Will he stay in your barn at night? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,10 Will he let you put ropes on him to plow your fields? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,"11 A wild bull is very strong, but can you trust him to do your work? "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,12 Can you trust him to gather your grain and bring it to your threshing place? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,"13 “An ostrich gets excited and flaps its wings, but it cannot fly. Its wings and feathers are not like the wings of a stork. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,14 An ostrich lays her eggs on the ground and lets the sand keep them warm. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,15 The ostrich forgets that someone might step on her eggs or that a wild animal might break them. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,"16 An ostrich leaves her little babies. She treats them as if they were not her own. If her babies die, she does not care that all her work was for nothing. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,"17 That’s because I did not give wisdom to the ostrich. She is foolish, and I made her that way. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,"18 But when the ostrich gets up to run, she laughs at the horse and its rider, because she can run faster than any horse. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,19 “Did you give the horse its strength? Did you put the mane* on its neck? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,20 Did you make it able to jump like a locust or snort† so loudly that it scares people? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,21 A horse is happy to be so strong. It scratches the ground with its foot and runs into battle. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,22 It laughs at fear; nothing makes it afraid! It does not run away from battle. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,23 The soldier’s quiver shakes on the horse’s side. The spear and weapons its rider carries shine in the sun. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,"24 The horse gets very excited and races over the ground.‡ When it hears the trumpet blow, it cannot stand still. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,"25 When the trumpet sounds, it snorts, ‘Hurray!’ It can smell the battle from far away and hear the shouts of commanders with all the other sounds of battle. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,26 “Did you teach the hawk how to spread its wings and fly south§? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,27 Are you the one who told the eagle* to fly high into the sky? Did you tell it to build its nest high in the mountains? *
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,28 It lives high on a peak at the top of a cliff. That is its fortress. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,"29 From there it looks far into the distance, searching for its food. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,39,"30 The eagles gather around dead bodies, and their young eat the blood.” 40 "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,"1 Then the LORD said to Job, "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,2 “You wanted to argue with God All-Powerful. You wanted to correct me and prove that I was wrong. So give me your answer!”

Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,4 “I am not worthy to speak! What can I say to you? I cannot answer you! I will put my hand over my mouth. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,"5 I spoke once, but I will not speak again. I spoke twice, but I will not say anything more.” "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,6 Then the LORD spoke to Job again from the storm 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,7 “Brace yourself* and get ready to answer the questions I will ask you. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,8 “Are you trying to show that I am unfair? Are you trying to look innocent by saying that I am guilty? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,9 Are your arms as strong as mine? Do you have a voice like mine that is as loud as thunder? 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,"10 If so, you can be proud and wear glory and honor like clothes. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,"11 If you are as powerful as God, then show your anger! Punish those who are proud and humble them. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,"12 Yes, just look at the proud and make them humble. Crush those evil people where they stand. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,13 Bury them all in the dirt. Wrap their bodies up and put them in their graves. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,"14 If you can do any of these things, then even I will praise you. And I will admit that you can save yourself by your own power. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,"15 “Look at the behemoth.† I made the behemoth, and I made you. He eats grass like a cow. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,16 But he has great strength in his body. The muscles in his stomach are powerful. *
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,17 His tail stands strong like a cedar tree. His leg muscles are very strong. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,18 His bones are as strong as bronze. His legs are like iron bars. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,"19 The behemoth is the most amazing animal I made, but I can defeat him. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,20 He eats the grass that grows on the hills where the wild animals play. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,21 He lies under the lotus plants. He hides among the reeds of the swamp. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,22 The lotus plants hide him in their shade. He lives under the willow trees that grow near the river. 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,"23 If the river floods, the behemoth will not run away. He is not afraid if the Jordan River splashes on his face. "
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,40,24 No one can blind his eyes and capture him. No one can catch him in a trap. 41 
Easy-to-Read Version__American,Job,41,1 “Can you catch Leviathan* with a fishhook? Can you tie his tongue with a rope?
